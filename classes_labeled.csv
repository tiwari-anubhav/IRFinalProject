0,"Not going to write a long review, even thought this unit deserves one. I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6"" bridges when I'm 13'6"". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units.,
","You would be crazy to buy here... its cheaper anywhere else.  UPDATE  I see amazon is now selling at the same price as the rest of the world so I retract...Also discovered another negative... When browsing the web the nook works fine on all sites EXCEPT AMAZON, now fancy that.  It will stay on amazon about 30 seconds then pop back to where ever I was before web browsing.  I've tried it over and over does it every time.Thanks to all who commented about the ability to still root the nook.  it is more complicated now but doable.  I'm debating about giving it a try.  Updated 1/22/12There are things to like about the nook, BUTNo android marketB&N; wants your credit card to download FREE apps -  ain't gonna happenstuff that is free on Android Market cost money at the B&N; app store.  I.E. Angry Birds costs 2.99 but is free from Android Market.I bought this Nook because it was root-able... but no longer with the latest update B&N; blocks attempt to root the device.BOO HISS ON B&N.;I never buy anything Apple because of the closed system.  I totally believe in Open architecture for electronic devices.  The closed system ONLY benefits the seller not the user.If all you want is a reader, email and the web.  then hey go for it.  but I truly disappointed and may return it.,
","I used it to mount a 32"" LCD TV to the wall... about 28LBS.  I installed it in less than 1/2 hour and am very happy with the results.PROS:-Comes with all of the hardware you'll need-Comes with some extra hardware of which I have NO IDEA what it is there for.  I suspect it's a 'universal' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models, but it's nice to have a little 'extra' (which is always better than not enough!)-The included Level is nice... well it's cheap but it works!-The instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit.CONS:-Metal is just a tad on the flimsy side.  I have no problems trusting it with my &lt;30lb television but if I were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs, I think I would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up.-The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don't feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn't even be an issue.-The metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it.  I mounted the base just a little bit ""off level"" to help compensate for this, and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me.CONCLUSION:  All in all It's not a bad unit.. ESPECIALLY for the price.  Yes I would have liked to see a sturdier unit, but when you take into account the &lt;$30 price tag, it's an excellent bargain.  I don't think I'll have any issue with a static mounting of my TV in the corner of the bedroom *BUT* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic, constant repositioning, etc... then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier.,

1,"The Nook Tablet, in both the 16gb version and 8 gb version, are the best color e-readers of 2012.  Both are bargains when purchased at the discounted price Barnes & Noble provides to its members.However, they are designed for reading...if you want a gaming tablet, a Skype video tablet, or need access to thousands of apps, you need an I-Pad.I have owned a ""Brand X"" color e-reader for about a year, but seldom use it for reading because it causes eye strain. I have a Nook Simple Touch e-reader that is wonderful for books, but its e-ink screen is black on white only, which does not work well for colorful magazines such as ""Automobile"" or ""National Geographic"".Barnes & Noble has an offer that enables its members to buy the Nook tablet for MUCH less than the price quoted by internet vendors, so I took advantage of their offer...plus the staff of my neighborhood Barnes & Noble were very helpful, and invited me to classes they provide to teach new owners the in's and out's of their new tablet. Mine is the 8gb version, which works as well as the 16gb version. I added a 32gb memory card, so my Nook has more storage for books than I could ever fill.The Nook Tablet is the best of both worlds. It is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions because its screen was designed to prevent eye strain. The fonts are very clear, very sharp, and have very high contrast, enabling you to read with the screen set at a very low brightness level, eliminating eye strain. Independent tests have verified that the Nook tablet has less reflection and glare than any color e-reader or color tablet, because the screen's glass cover is bonded directly to the LCD, eliminated the air gap that causes glare.The vivid color makes magazines ""pop"" even more than their paper versions. Barnes & Noble adds a special ""text only"" option for magazine articles that make it easy to read the text by enlarging the fonts and putting the text of the article in a single long file.The Nook ""shop"" does not work as well as the Nook website on the internet for searching for specific books or categories of books. So, I downloaded the Dolphin HD browser from the Nook shop and use it to look at the Nook shop's book inventory. The Dolphin browser uses tabs, so I can put two or three books I am considering in their own tab, and switch back and forth.The Nook Tablet has Pandora Radio installed, so I can listen to my favorite music while I read books. The sound is weak through the Nook tablet's puny speaker, but wonderful through good earbuds. I also transferred about fifty of my favorite CD's to the Nook's memory card, so I can listen to music even when I am not near an internet connection.When I get tired of reading, the Nook tablet lets me watch movies and tv shows on Netflix or TV.Com. Movies on Netflix look wonderful, because the color balance on the Nook tablet is superior to that of any seven inch tablet currently available. Skin tones are difficult to get ""right"", but the Nook tablet does a great job.Many reviewers make the error of comparing the Nook Tablet to full-blown tablets, such as the Apple I-Pad. The Nook Tablet is designed to be an e-reader, and for that purpose, it is superior to any of its seven inch competition. The fact that it includes Pandora Radio and Netflix is a bonus...but it IS an e-reader. The Nook Shop has a relatively small number of apps, each of which has been tested to verify it works well with the Nook tablet's seven inch screen...most Android apps are designed for a three inch or four inch screen.The reading apps for children are impressive. Last week I downloaded a free children's book that combined the best of the ""book world"" and the ""video world"". The book played music in the background...as a character walked through a field, the flowers were swaying in the wind. The book provided an option to have a character read the book out loud, and an option to turn the voice off, so your child can read the book to herself. Many of the children's reading apps are free, or cost less than $5, a bargain compared with the $15 or $20 children's books sell for in stores.The Nook website offers a ""book of the day"" for adults and a ""book of the day"" for children. The illustrations in the children's books take advantage of the Nook's color screen. Yesterday's children's book was ""Mary Poppins"", a bargain for $2...but the REAL Mary Poppins seems a bit scary compared with the Julie Andrew's Disney version.For people who want MORE than just the world's best e-reader, Amazon.com sells a $35 SD card that converts the Nook Tablet into a conventional Android tablet with full access to Google Play and its vast array of Android apps. Just put the N2A card into the Nook's card slot, and restart the Nook. When you want to use it as just an e-reader, take the N2A card back out. Best of both worlds...the best seven inch color e-reader becomes a very good seven inch Android tablet.,
","I received the Nook as a Christmas present.  I already own a Kindle latest generations, 3g/wifi.  However I soon discovered that not all books are available on the Kindle and 99.9% of the books I couldn't get on my Kindle are on Nook.  After much research I soon learned that if you want good ebook reader you buy either a Kindle or a Nook.  So I asked Santa for it.I will not tell you I like the Nook better than my Kindle or my Kindle better than my Nook.  Both have excellent features that make them both excellent ereaders.Here's a few on the Nook:  1- It keeps the book title, time, and battery charge visible while reading.  2-It starts up just a bit faster than the Kindle.  3-You can use your own photos for the screen saver and wallpaper.  4-it recognizes the table of contents in PDF books.  5-it reads EPUB file types (meaning you can buy books from Borders.com too and read them)As for the Kindle here are a few features I love about it:  1-I like the real keyboard as the buttons are much easier to push than on screen.  2-It reads PDFS much better than the Nook, more so when you have the PDF converted.  3-the page turns are a bit faster.  4-I prefer the black housing to white.  5-the reading page/screen has no glare at all (the Nook's little color panel on the bottom is very reflective) and it seems the print is a little darker.Both the Nook and Kindle are very easy to purchase and load books on.  I think the thing I was most disappointed in with the Nook are the covers.  They are not enough covers that actually close, like the Kindle and when sticking this reader into your purse or bag, you don't want the cover to open and scratch the screen/reading surface.If you are looking for a great ereader, you cannot go wrong with this Nook or the Kindle latest generation, in my book they are both on the top shelf.  Now if we could just get one that is a smashed together version of both their great features into one unit.Update:  After using both my Nook and Kindle for a while now I've decided I do like the Kindle much better than the Nook.  The page turning buttons on the Kindle are very very light touch, the reading screen does have darker print, and the collections feature is top notch.  Now my Nook, the buttons take some pushing to turn the pages, the reading screen is lighter, and the shelves option is ok.  What I don't care for in the shelves feature is I can't colapse the shelves to just show the shelves and then open them when I want to search in them.  I also don't care for the B&N; Library being seperate from My Documents.  On the Kindle these are all included together and you can sort them out using collections.  With the Nook you must use the naviation screen to switch between them.  I've also had some trouble with the navigation screen on the bottom.  I don't have large fingers and don't wear long fingernails so moving around on the screen should be easy.  However, when I'm tryting to scroll or select something on the touch screen I just can't seem to get what I want.  But when I don't mean to move on the touch screen but accidently touch it, I trigger a menu move.  It's still a very good reader, but when comparing options and usability, I'd choose the Kindle any day over the Nook.  I'll purchase most of my books on the Kindle and what isn't Kindlized will go on the Nook.,
","Unfortunately, I'm returning this mount.Though I like the look of it, particularly the two part plastic piece that clips to the wall mount portion to cover the bolts, I feel that the one I ordered wasn't well made.I purchased it to mount aLG 26LE5300 26-Inch 720p 60Hz LED LCD HDTVin our kitchen.The mount arrived quickly and was well packaged. Unfortunately, the arm was welded to the wall bracket at a slight angle, meaning that regardless of how it would mount it and the LCD would never be level.Also, the powder coating near one of the bolts had come off and I could see some rust already forming.I decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning, figuring I would just get a replacement and hope for the best. I'm glad I did because this led me to find two other issues.The first one I blame on the manufacturers, the second I would consider a design flaw of the LG lcd.The first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short. The screws are only 12mm long, and would barely catch in the threads of the TV if they weren't recessed at all. Most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed. I stopped by my local Lowes and picked up two packs of similar screws (M4-70 or something to that affect). $0.80 a packet so not much of an expenditure, just a big hassle. I needed 20mm long screws to mount this to the tv, so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied. The manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options, but only one shallow length of each set.The second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and HDMI ports on the back of the 26le5300. Again, I think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount, as they're situated rather high and central. Either way, it's something you'll want to check on your tv before ordering this product.I actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company. TheVideoSecu Swing LCD Wall Mount 20 inch Extension 55 lb loading capacity for LCD TV Monitor Flat Screen VESA 75mm/100 mm 1USgets very high marks from me. It's basically the same arm with a 75x75 to 100x100 VESA head on it. This second arm did not have any of the manufacturing errors of the previous model and fit the back of my tv perfectly.I understand that it's a very affordable mount, and that most of my issues may have been resolved with a replacement. However, I just can't give this mount any higher rating than I have.,
"
2,"Months later, I am still happy with this Tablet, but you should know 2 things. One is, you'll get it for $224 if you're a B&N; member.  Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet.  To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&N; store.  BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com.  This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that.  There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook.  Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book.  I find B%N and Amazon charge about the same for books. There are some books on Nook that Kindle doesn't have, and some on Kindle that Nook doesn't have.  However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.One other thing: the Nook has a tab for ""My Stuff"" so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it.  Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures.  For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app.  I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire.  However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)Hands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook.  Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features.  Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too.  However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99.  Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, ""Wow! it's as good as the Sony!""  Yes, and for about the half the price.Another salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies.  Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me.  B&N; has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free.  Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free.  They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books.  You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text.  Some of the old books are also Enhanced.  Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined.  You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka.  You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to.  In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web.  You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook.  Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is  not enough for you, you  can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.That's not all!  If you're App happy, you  can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty.  I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week.  Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet.  Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail.  She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook.  I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my  Nook.The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does  have both.  If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook.  The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is.  I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device.  Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix.  There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not ""locations"" like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.  It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad.  As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's.  The iPad3 will have hi def, however.,
","I purchased two certified nook colors directly from B&N;, for my kids to read ebooks on, and for some entertainment on long trips, Dr's appts, etc.Things I like about the device:-versatility- now has netflix- great little device for entertainment, as well as reading.-user interface:  much improved following the last update, both navigating the device itself and B&N;'s store.-option for expandable storage- handy for music and mp4's.-ability to make the device 'kid friendly'; the internet can be disabled, and purchases can be made to require your account password.Things I dislike about the device:-Read in store feature only for certain books, and virtually no kids' books.  The impression I got from B&N;'s webpage was that it was for all ebooks.  This was the main reason why I picked these up instead of waiting for the Kindle Fire to be released.  Major disappointment.-Charger cable sucks.  The cable itself is weak where the usb adapter attaches to the cable, and is very easy to bend and break.  one cable is now broken at that spot, and the other is close to it.  These cables are easily replaceable, so not a huge deal, but I expected better quality...  Also, the power adapter is quite bulky.-did not update automatically.  I had to manually install the most recent update (allowing me to disable internet, and install netflix). it was relatively easy to do, following directions from B&N;'s webpage, but there should be a way to check for updates from the device itself.-loses battery life fairly quickly while on standby.-no free games & limited games (maybe apple spoiled me...)-prices for apps and books seem generally higher than on my kindle (I have not made direct comparisons, this is just my general impression)I will try and see if I can lend books through my local library; this may allow me to use it more for it's intended purpose.Overall, the device itself is quite good- just not for what I had intended it for (in store reading- with the option to purchase the book, in print, from the store).If I had purchased the device for myself, however, it would have been returned.  My kids do enjoy reading on it, playing angry birds, watching netflix, etc. so I will keep it for their use.Edit:The nook colours use a usb longer than a standard micro usb; a standard micro usb cable will not charge the nook colour.  I did contact B&N; (I initially took my nooks into a B&N; store for assistance, and was referred to their tech support 1-800 number.  So much for the in store tech support...)  I was able to recieve two new cables under warranty, though.I am generally happy with the tech support provided over the phone, but am still disappointed by the quality of the charging cable, and the inability of B&N; to solve this issue in-store.,
","When B&N; designed this one, they were putting together a reading device that also happened to have some tablet features. As a result, what you get is pretty limited.It's a fairly sturdy device by feel, and not difficult to hold for a while and use. The quality of the screen is pretty good and it's not difficult to read for extended periods of time (so long as you're not out in the sun anyway, almost all LCD screens perform poorly there).Very little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default, so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that.You can sideload content from any source that uses Adobe DRM for epubs, and also epubs that don't have DRM at all. This means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple. You can install an Overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive.You can root it to get access to more apps. If you want to run a more pure version of Android, you can go for either putting together a Cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from Nook2Android.B&N; gives away a book and an app every Friday on their blog, so that's worth checking in on regularly.On the whole, this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice semi-tablet to give to someone who normally tends to load their computers/tablets up with viruses by being carelessness. It's locked-down state works in your favor from that perspective.For more general tablet use, this is a pretty poor choice. Also, as of mid-2013 the later devices (Nook HD/HD+) have been radically marked down, so if you're going to buy one of these you should look to get it pretty cheap. Otherwise, it'd almost certainly make more sense to hold out for something more full-featured.,

3,"I bought this ebook (16G) for my Kindergarten and elementary children to read books on trips and my old child to check email. It does the jobs well until now. I personally like it very much for its excellent hardware performance. With low price, fast response, and light weight, book size, and Barn and Nobles support, It is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computer.I am a fan of Amazon.com and meant to buy a kindle for my children. but the displayed sample on my local Bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire. It could not be generally true, but based on the displayed tablets, I had to choose the nook.Until now, I have had mainly happy experiences with it. It has apps for children, one of them has many Smithsonian videos that my small children love the most. My college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up, and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow. After you turn it off and restart it (hold the power button for seconds for on and off), it become fast again.I just found last day it has a recipe App with more than 17,000 recipes. It has pictures for most of the products.My children have asked me to buy the istory app for 3.99 dollars, but it contends 24 or more story books for children that it reads to my children. Wonderful! The American history app is excellent too, It costs me 1 dollar or so (not remember exactly now).Problems: It did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running. After the battery was charged for a whole night, it still refused to start. When I tried again in the afternoon, it started but took more than 10 minutes. I guess the software was damaged and repaired. It is now as good as it was before. I am still wondering what was wrong with it.It is not a computer and can not be connected to TV. only one or two of my children can use it in the same time. We still have to use computers when we want to enjoy movies or photos together.It was designed for you to buy their books. but I think the prices of most books are not low enough for me to purchase e version. I would rather buy some hard copies instead. However, one of my children loves the classical books which are free or only one dollar each. She is happy with the books.As a summary, the machine is excellent, sturdy, fast, and convenient for emails and web browsing. The books are not priced low enough for me to purchase although there are some old free books. Apps for children are wonderful. My children love it.,
","I bought the Nook color after using the original Nook wifi to read a few books.  I'm sure like many people I was drawn to the ""color"" of the screen.  It is crystal clear, it's great for books with drawings or art in them.  Really brings it to life.  This is about all I've really liked.What I don't like is its heavy.  Compared to the original Nook and the Kindle it's a heavy monster.  The screen glares with everything.  I hate seeing myself in the screen when I'm trying to read.  The touchablilty of the screen is 100 times better than the b/w Nook.  It doesn't turn when you turn the Nook itself, even though you have the screen adjustment feature turned on.  Did I mention it was heavy?  Also I took it outside and yes I adjusted the brightness all the way up.  However, I could not read the screen with my sunglasses on even at its brightest setting.  It's like my Iphone, can't see the screen in sunlight.  This is the part that frustrated me the most.  Also the lighted background of the reading screen seemed to make my eyes excessively tired after long periods of reading.  The battery life is pretty short too.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this ereader.  Get the Kindle, you'll be much happier and it's cheaper.  Also Kindle books don't charge tax to buy them like Nookbooks.,
","I pulled the trigger on three of these on pre-order back in November.  I'd cancelled my order for as many Kindle Fires because I felt the technical specs justified the extra $50 for the Nook Tablet.  I also appreciated more onboard storage and expandability since we're a four person family and I drive ... all three were for my wife and kids and not me, and I expected they'd be used on the road a lot.I think that by the time anyone reads this they should know that the tablets (both Kindle and Nook, to be fair) are tied to their respective distributors.  That didn't come as any surprise to me, I fully expected it.  I knew that, without modifying the device (not really acceptable for your average person, if you ask me), I would be stuck with B&N;'s app store.  What I didn't know was how woefully limited that app store really is; it pales in comparison to Amazon's and doesn't even register when compared to the android marketplace.My daughter got hers first (a late birthday present).  For the most part, she was satisfied with it.  I made sure wifi was available throughout the house; we downloaded a couple of apps (Angry Birds, of course, and a drawing program).  The first thing to notice is that the B&N; app store has a tiny selection of free apps.  The ad-sponsored version of Angry Birds can't be found, but for a couple of bucks I didn't mind paying - I paid for the non-ad version for my phone, too.Netflix works as well on the tablet as it does on any other device in my home (PS3 and a bluray player, both hardwired networking) as long as wifi connection is good.  Her other use was email, and since she hardly gets any, the built in app was OK.The other two tablets I purchased were for Christmas for my wife and son, and that's where the problems started.  My wife gets copious amounts of email from several different accounts and likes to keep it as neat as possible... she also uses her smartphone and computer and doesn't want to have to delete things three times.  The built in email application absolutely sucks.  You can't even empty the trash to completely delete messages you don't want.  We experienced this on our phones and installed the highest rated email app we could find on the android marketplace, which also happened to be a FREE app.  B&N; makes nothing by distributing free apps in their marketplace, so this app was not available at all, and the selection was slim for other apps.  Even the touchpad app that people were using to syncronize with Microsoft Exchange servers apparently doesn't work (and is very expensive for an app).As I mentioned, I knew I'd be limited to B&N; app store - I just didn't realize how limited that app store was.My wife then started getting a bunch of free samples of books, and bought several of them.  They all downloaded except one stubborn one.  That book would load just fine on all the other Nooks in our house (the other two Tablets and we have two original Nooks, as well).  I sent an email to technical support and received the usual ""we got your request and will reply as soon as possible"" message, along with the addition that they are experiencing a high volume of help requests.  That was a week ago and we still have not heard back.  After a few days, though, we physically took the Nook to the store to get help.  Nothing worked; off/on, archive/unarchive, even de and re-registered the device (losing our wifi and email configs in the process).  This book still will not load.We finally ""side loaded"" the book, which required installing a program on my wife's PC (which is very annoying in itself) and we were required to create an Adobe ID (how much spam will we get from them, I wonder?).  After side-loading the book, it has no cover art... more annoyance.  That book still won't download correctly, even after they told us it'd be fixed in 48 hours (that was five days ago).I am not one to ""root"" products like these (especially since they aren't ""mine,"" as I won't be the one using them).  As the ""guy,"" it seems I'm responsible for all technical support in the house and didn't want to deal with the ramifications (or, frankly, even take the time to run through all those steps to do it).  It's not that I can't, it's that it's a pain in the buttocks and I simply shouldn't have to.  We were not asking for the world, we were asking for a table that had Nook e-reader software and allowed a few other niceties.  I wasn't expecting an iPad for $250, but I was expecting working software and a functional email program.It's technically not a bad tablet - the screen is bright and clear and responsive; the UI is decent (although I prefer the four buttons on my android phone over the single big ""n"" button on the Nook).  It's solidly built and sturdy; with Angry Birds and Netflix as my only benchmarks I can say they both run much better than they do on my phone, with no pauses (that I saw) in Angry Birds at all.However, the accumulation of annoyances was a bit too much for me (let's say there was a nagging voice coming from somewhere... the other side of the bed).  I am returning all three - luckily B&N; has a holiday policy that will allow me to return them, which is very cool of them.  They have not lost me as a customer; I have my books purchased from them and will continue to buy.I hope them the best in the future; it was a nice try.  If they just weren't so tight fisted about control over content (especially apps, in this case) I'd have stuck with it.  Technically speaking, the device is quite good and, at the current time, IMO, the hardware is worth the price tag.  I wouldn't mind being limited to the B&N; app store if they actually offered more apps... a LOT more, as they have practically nothing compared to what's available for the android community at large.  Again, I'm not asking for an iPad; I know the iPad can do some really cools things this Tablet can't, just something to make the ""tablet"" part of the Nook Tablet more worthwhile.I imagine they'll fix glitches with the download problem, too.  I'm not the only person who had a problem, but I think everyone else managed to find a solution (besides side-loading).  Keep in mind I generally know what I'm doing and tried everything, and the ""expert"" at the brick-and-mortar store couldn't fix it, either.  The lady from Glee didn't come out and entertain us while they fixed our tablet, either... that was disappointing.So that's my review - it's decent hardware hamstrung by a few bugs and tight fisted control over content.  Some will argue that it's not meant to be a tablet, it's meant to be an e-reader, but let's be honest - it's marketed as a tablet; it's called the Nook TABLET.  It doesn't have to be an iPad, but it should work a lot better than it does at being a tablet.,
"
4,"I went to a few places just to try testing them out, best place to test them out first hand was BN. The people at Walmart didn't want you near them, and didn't know ANYTHING about them. Best Buy was pretty much the same, except you could 'sorta' test them out. BN though had people trained to know EVERYTHING about them, even the stuff that was not listed about them on the BN website.First thing not listed: if the Nook Colour can do it, so can the Nook Tablet. (for instance... read .cbz files without installing any extra apps)The 16gb model was much more responsive than the 8gb, so to me it was well worth the extra 50 bucks.Add to that that currently if you buy one at BN and don't like it, you have 2 weeks to return it for a full refund as long as it is still in new condition (so no attempting to root the device, which from what the rep told me will brick it unlike the Colour)that pretty much sold me, I found a place with micro SD cards on sale, bought a few, and took my Nook home.Pros:The screen is AWESOME! I use it for reading .cbz comics and .pdf files more than anything. The missing gap between the glass and screen made reading much better. Also the response on the touch screen was great.much better response time at turning pages, launching apps and using the inet that other tablets in the budget rangenative flash supportnative .cbz support (main reason I bought it)supports almost every popular ebook format except for .mobi (which can be converted to epub or .pdf anyway)good size for holding one handed for reading and lightweight (under a pound)battery life... 11 hours+ with wifi off, 8+ with it on, I tried it out and watched lots of movies and did some reading on it without it coming close to dying on me.a test drive opportunity if you buy it at BN and dont scratch it up or anything. I like the idea that I was able to take it home and so if it actually does everything that I want it to do wihtout a fear that I'm stuck with it for good.also if you buy it from BN you can buy an 'oops' return warranty (which means if you spill coffee on it or drop it, it can be replaced)affordable if you go without things like eating out 2x a week for awhileCons:lack of Android Market, lack of some apps I would like to see on the BN market (such as Google Music app) no sideloading apps at the moment either. That being said, this also means that apps available from BN will actually work with your Nook, there isnt a quantity over quality in the app store either. This means that if you've bought an app from Android market, you will have to buy it again if you want to use it on the Nook.The screen. trust me, I love it. But unlike other tablets where if you crack the glass you just have to replace the glass, on the Nook if you crack it, the screen is toastno front facing camera (or any camera for that matter). The ability to use Skype would have been nice, but wasn't a complete necessity. I've had many friends with tablets that had a camera that swear they never used it even once, and thinking about it, I wuld seldom use it either since most places outsite of my house that I will use it are places where video chatting would be frowned on, like Starbucks or the libraryno bluetooth, which to me didn't matter, but it seems to be an issue for some people. There IS bluetooth, but it's disabled and there isn't a way to enable itno GPS, this would be nice, unlike bluetooth, I would actually use it.mono speaker instead of stereo, again seems to be an issue for other people, I plug it into the minijack on my surround sound at home or the jack in my car stereo when I'm on the road though and its just fine. I use headphones if I'm out and about. Why on earth would I care about speakers that I never use anyway?no .flac support. a good chunk of my digital music now is .flac. it does have .ogg support thoughno .avi support. again, a massive portion of my movies etc are all in .avi format. It does have .mkv and .mp4 support though, so from here on out I will just have to rip my video files in those formats if I plan on watching them on it.lack of decent accessories selection. lets face it, the case market seems to be geared toward people that worship at the church of Steve, and the availability of accessories shows it.,
","I bought the Nook Color for its intended role as an ebook reader. I have a Kindle DX but it has trouble with many of the tabletop RPG PDFs I throw at it and the 4GB is a tad small to hold my 14GB collection. The built-in PDF reader is worthless, slow to open files the Kindle DX had no trouble with and wouldn't even turn pages. I jail broke it, install a mostly vanilla image of Froyo and installed Adobe Acrobat and from there it shined. Page turning and navigation was a breeze and it complimented (read not-replaced) the Kindle DX quite well.It's a tad small for anything more in-depth than book reading and Angry Birds. Even casual web browsing can be a pain and it's place as a bastard hybrid of a phone OS on a 7"" tablet form factor means it has the worst of both worlds. Maybe once (if?) Android tablets take off we'll see mobile pages more suited to them. The huge up side is that it fits perfectly in a large coat pocket and looks sleek enough to make you look cool removing it from the pocket of an aviator jacket.In the end it spends most of its time sitting on a shelf collecting dust. It'll probably end up a gift for someone who doesn't mind lower-end electronics. These days while the Kindle Fire looks good I'm waiting on the market to mature and Windows 8 tablets to ship before I go looking again.,
","I own the original Nook e-ink reader and the Nook tablet.  I have been happy with both.  When I read all the wonderful reviews about the Nook HD+ I couldn't wait to buy one.  The main reason that I bought the reader is that my vision has deteriorated over the years to where I need at least 16 point type.  The availability of different sized type on the reader devices is very welcome.  I use the tablet, not only for reading, but to watch Netflix movies while on my exercise bike.  The Nook tablet works okay for that, but the larger display of the HD+ seemed that it would be an improvement.  However, there are several problems with the current edition:There needed to be at least one more font size at the high-end.  I had to choose between too small and too large.The sound level was too low, even with headphones.  I could not find a Barnes and Noble application to provide better control over the volume.  There are a number of third-party applications which used to work on the Nook tablet that are now locked out by the current OS version.So, in spite of the beautiful display, I reluctantly returned the HD+ to my local store.  When planning future upgrades.  I would advise Barnes & Noble to consider the needs of older customers and people with disabilities.  We are not an insignificant market segment.,
"
5,"I read all the reviews and decided to buy this Barnes and Noble Nook for my Grandson for Christmas it was used but with original box and accesories  through EZ CORPS!!!  And I'm happy to say this Barnes and Noble is the best I ever invested in the picture and color is beautiful. Let's put it this way my niece that has the kindle was checking out the Barnes and Noble nook and compared it to her kindle said that the Barnes and Noble Nook has a clear picture than her kindle and more apps!!! And I told her I did my homework and looked this Nook up and it had the best reputation as far as for a kid,Young teen, Best nook ever invested in money and used at that but I will only order used if the item says like New with original Box with Accesories . And  I will only order anything used through EZ CORPS!! Best company to ever order anything from on Amazon fast professional customer service and love there shipping and handling !! And there all there used products are tested before selling which is a plus. I would Highly recommend this company any day to any one , Friends,Family,etc,Yes this Barnes & Noble Nook is well worth ordering used or new. Thank you Kristen Cates.,
","I bought this to replace a Sony PRS-300 that I thought was too heavy and too slow in the page turning.  Yes, the nook is quicker on the page turning and lighter but I am having too much trouble to appreciate faster and lighter.  I am having an infinite amount of trouble getting library books onto the nook - I've yet to succeed and the problems lie with adobe digital editions.  Why aren't nooks plug and play?  That's my first big problem.  I have no problem with my Sony and the library book I wanted is now on my Sony.  The second is that I like to read while I'm eating my lunch - ereader in left hand and fork in right.  It is not easy to change the page on the nook while eating - the bottom right corner is too far from my thumb and the bottom buttons are too high up the side.  The Sony has a set of buttons right in the bottom center, which is perfect placement.  I read the great reviews on the nook and for the price, I thought it was worth a try.  I'm also disappointed with the wifi registration requirement and wifi in general.  I don't need wifi on my ereader but it looks like they're all offering it now.  I also don't appreciate my registration info being used by B&N; as permission to start emailing me crap - I am already unsubscribed from that 'service'.  I'm definitely not happy with the nook and I'm going to save up my money to buy another Sony.**UPDATE 5/25/13**  I finally was able to download library books onto my nook but it was frustrating and time consuming; I finally found help online.  I have yet to discover a way to comfortably hold this book in my left hand and turn the page.  This was a very bad buy for me.  I bought a book-style cover for it and that was a waste of money as well as I find the cover just gets in the way.  I did not know how good I had it with the Sony PRS-300 and will continue to use my Sony instead of the nook.  I don't recommend the nook at all.,
","i got a 16gb microsd off of amazon for under $14.00 and it holds just little over 8k books, it was what swayed be over the kindle fire, that and the 1gb of ram vs 512mb. Now that they released a 8gb nook for $199.00 its price point is on par with the fire, and has the option of expansion, and  a simple hack allows for a custom android launcher, and i can easily install the amazon app store(and kindle app), android market place, and have a very decent wifi tablet, tbh i wasn't much of a analog book reader, but with this little nook tablet i've been averaging a book a week, along with .99-1.99 monthly magazine subscriptions.when the original nook first came out i purchased one and took it back 2hrs later, it was less then what i expected, but i think barnes and noble has come a long way and now this version is very impressive.battery life is decent, depending on your screen brightness preference and netflix usage, unless i am at home, i usually have the screen brightness at little less then half, and wifi off, and get about 6-9hrs of nonstop read time, 3 days of casual reading/standby.,
"
6,"For the price this is a great tablet. It lacks a camera, GPS, and bluetooth, but that still leaves a lot, between web browsing and running lots of Android apps. Barnes and Noble did cripple these with limited software through their store but I did get around that by rooting mine.That said, I was sort of surprised to see this pop up as something recommended by Amazon today. The newer version is faster, has a higher resolution screen, is lighter despite same screen size, and has bluetooth. (Still no camera or GPS). B&N; also is now allowing access to the Google Play Store. It is available on the newer version but I don't know if they updated the software for this one to allow access. I suspect they didn't but this would be something to check on if considering purchasing.If you want a tablet for web browsing, checking email, ebooks, video, and many other apps and this is as much as you want to spend, then it isn't a bad deal. I would recommend paying more for the newer version--the Nook HD. (They also make a version with a larger screen, the HD+)Also note that there are third party programs available which will allow you to boot a rooted Android system off of an SD card. This will give more options but I found the original Nook Tablet to be sluggish running off such a card--possibly because I also went to Jelly Bean and this might have been too much for the older tablet. I wound up going back to running the rooted software directly off the tablet (but rooting is more work than inserting a card). The HD works well off a rooted Jelly Bean card.,
","Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of Amazon.com. In the past month alone, I have made at least 12 purchases.  I was browsing around just now and decided to see what Amazon.com customers thought of my newest electronic device.  I was thrilled to see the high rating, but disappointed to see the price; $40.00 more than the thing costs at B/N since its release last month.  Amazon, you need to do better here!Now to the product - This is my first e-reader and I am certain that I went with the best product for me.  As someone who buys a lot of books from Amazon, I would have preferred to have bought the Kindle,especially since Amazon has more of the types of books I read and for much cheaper than B/N, but I just do not appreciate those tiny buttons on the device.  I absolutely LOVE my Nook Simple Touch, and I use it for several hours every day.  B/N has Free Fridays - when you can download a featured book for free -, book share -with contacts on your device and social networks, and free reading of selected books when you are in B/N.  My understanding is that I can go to local libraries and even borrow my books using my Nook; This may or may not be any special news.The touch screen is a bit sensitive on the device, so if you prefer not to use it, they are also tactile ""buttons"" that will allow you to change pages.  The home screen shows the book you are currently reading and the page number you are on - a few other books in your library, and some suggested readings.  You can create shelves that you name on which to house your books by categories. They do not look like physical shelves, rather they are just a grouping of books.Without going into more technical stuff that you can read online, I will say that if you are new to e-reading and you enjoy touch screens -  AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS YOU TO READ - Do not hesitate to go into a B/N and try this out.  Some people buy this expecting it to browse the web (although it does have a hidden browser that the techies are working to hack) - Play their audio files, when there is not headphone jack (Techies have discovered that it DOES have built-in bluetooth, however), and folks buy this and complain that they do not like how it does not display their magazines in color.  It is not meant to do that - it is meant to be solely an enjoyable easy-to-use reading device that does not give you a whole lot of options to be distracted from the task at hand, READING!This is why I bought it - Eventually, I will get a nook color - or a Kindle *color* if they come out with one, but for now, I thoroughly  enjoy my Nook, which has encouraged me to slow down and spend so much more time in the peaceful, leisurely act of reading. In my excitement, I am reading like 8 different books at once.  That is the great joy of having an e-reader - speaking to those who are, just as I used to be, resistant to the e-reading craze - there is no more lugging around a bag filled with books, and when I get tired of reading one, another book is just a couple of swipes away. I am learning about how to get all sorts of books for free or low cost, as well as learning how to take advantage of conversion and e-book management tools such as Calibre.  I am having a blast with this thing!Yesterday, I received a nice leather case for it that I purchased off Ebay for a great price.  Once again, I looked to Amazon.com first, but there simply were not good options.  I got a black leather Caseen case that also came with a screen protector for twenty bucks.,
","Between this and other popular competitors there isn't a lot of difference in hardware.  The software and usability is noticeably different though, and that's where you should pay close attention.  I bought my wife the Nook Tablet for Christmas and she uses it a fair amount.  I haven't heard any major complaints from her but here are the ones I've heard most often.The Barnes and Noble App Store is a joke.  I looked through it for about 5 minutes and barely ever saw a free app.  Many popular apps and games are there, but usually you can only get the paid version.  Adding insult to injury, side-loading is difficult if not impossible without rooting the device (this will void the warranty).  I didn't expect side-loading to be a given really, but if you block those apps you really need a decent App Store to make up for it.The SD card slot, which many people may not ever use, is in a pretty odd spot.  It's not really hard to pry back the cover but since you're working with a micro-SD card it can be really annoying to  line up such a tiny card in the slot.  If that wasn't annoying, it is definitely annoying to load your PDFs or whatever from the SD card once its inserted.  For someone who isn't really tech-savvy it isn't obvious how to read those files.  The reader app could really do a better job of detecting documents when the SD card is inserted.On the aesthetic side the launcher could use some work.  Although I think the scrolling app dock at the bottom is slightly more elegant than a grid-like app drawer, there's little organization to the home screen.  You can drag icons around, to and from the dock, but apps/books don't lock to any kind of grid on the home screen.  Some of us who are more anal retentive just won't stand for two icons being less than parallel.  You can see a better view of your media by opening the Library app, which is a nice app, but I find the contrast displeasing, further emphasizing this is a tablet with e-reader functions (or vice versa maybe).  Basically the cohesion isn't there and you start to wonder, with all of the restrictions, why you didn't just get a regular tablet.I still haven't rooted my wife's tablet but maybe if something annoys her enough she'll let me do it.  Otherwise, if you're not planning to root the NOOK, beware of its restrictions and browse its App Store for a bit to see if the selection and prices are a deal-breaker.  This is an e-reader FIRST and a tablet SECOND.  If you're satisfied with its e-reader capabilities I'm sure you'll be happy with this device.,
"
7,"Just picked up a refurbished Nook Tablet from newegg's website and its amazing. Only has a 1024 x 600 pixel screen but from a foot away you can't tell the different between this and a device with 1200 x 800 pixels or more. Reading is a pleasure. I've had all the Kindles and all the Nooks and for the best overall reading experience the Nook is better.Why? The Nook devices feel great to hold. The plastics are soft, all the buttons are in good places, and recharging takes no time at all. Also, the software layout and navigation is easy and logical. Next, the font choices, sizes, and other personalizations are all useful. And finally, no freaking ads. You can personalize your home screen and on the Nook Touch you can select your own photos for the screen saver.What's my problem then with Kindle? Couple things. The ads of course. Also, I personally don't care for the software. You are stuck in their software with no way to personalize it. Boring! Also, the buttons are in bad places so you can accidentally shut the device off. On the lower priced Kindles the font choices are fewer and the smaller size choices are useless unless you use a magnifying glass. And the devices aren't as nice to hold. At least on the Fires they took the idea from Nook on making the backs have a soft plastic.I'm pretty sure that anyone who takes the time to try both Nook and Kindle will like the Nook better. As reading devices go they just make more sense. As far as a full fledged tablet goes you'll have to look to Apple or Samsung in my opinion. Matter of fact I am writing this review on my iPad and shortly I will go back to reading on my Nook Tablet.,
","I know Amazon is going to hate me for this but here goes:I used to have a Kindle 3. It was great. It made reading a pleasure however there were a couple of things I would have liked to change. I wished that it had a touch screen and that it was smaller.When I saw the Nook Touch I thought that this is what my Kindle should be like. Well I decided to buy the Nook and I'm very, very pleased. I won't go into an in depth review of the device itself. You can find that just about anywhere. What I will say is the touch screen makes things so much easier. I love the on screen virtual keyboard (like the ipad) and the fact that it's a lot smaller than the Kindle 3 but with the same size and quality screen.Since giving the Kindle to a relative I thought about the books that I already bought from Amazon and the fact that I now have to use my Android phone to read them since the Nook does not read Kindle books......or does it??With a little research I was able to find out how to root my Nook Touch (voids your warranty). Now when I turn on the Nook, it gives me a dual boot screen (sort of). I can go to the Android desktop or the the Nook screen. Using the Android desktop which included the Android market I downloaded the Kindle reading app. I ran that app, logged into my Kindle account and now have all my Kindle book available on my Nook Touch. The only thing missing is text to speech but I didn't use that feature anyway. Yes it has a web browser, email and all the other Android apps available but most look pretty drab on a monochrome device. That isn't why I did this. I wanted a device to read my Nook Books and Kindle books.I now have the best of both worlds.,
","I am the occasional reader but, I bought this for tablet capability.  It can be rooted in about 2 minutes to have app store.  Once that is done, You can use a home screen alternative and program to switch it to hide the overbearing and hindering B&N; store.  It's still there but, not right in my face. Default browser is OK  but, I prefer Dolphin HD.  It's much more than half and Ipad at exactly half the price.  Plus, when used as a reader, it's just light and small enough to be effective at that purpose.  I had a Pandigital novel that I got for Xmas that completely died in 3 weeks.  I took the refund money and made the smartest purchase that I can remember making:  The Nook Color.  The novel is pure garbage compared to this device.  Android 2.1 is so much better than 1.6.  I also couldn't get many apps to run on the novel  where this runs almost everything. Spend the extra $ and get the color.  Save the extra money from the Ipad. I was considering Archos 70 but, I couldn't find anywhere to actually play with it.  Plus, given their history; I had decided against it.Good:Nice screen,  capacitive touch,  strong wifi, decent battery life, Nice CPU @ 800 MHz,  512 MB RAM  Ipad only has 256  supposedly), Tons of free apps available, very reasonably priced,  portable,  Barnes and Noble magazines  very reasonably priced at $1 to $3 an issue), microsd slot.Bad  minor complaints):that silly plastic thing in the corner, mono speaker, micorsd slot instead of sdhc card slot, doesn't come with android market.Overall this is the best tablet for the money currently and probably will be for quite a while.UPDATE.  Couple of small annoyances: randomly reboots instead of sleeping, wireless doesn't come back up sometimes after rebooting.  Still very happy with it though. Sleep issue apparently also happens to those who haven't rooted.  I'm sure it will be fixed with update.UPDATE:  I am very unhappy with Barnes and Noble's many attempts to update my firmware without my permission.  They have tried twice and didn't succeed.  I believe that AVG antivirus is stopping it.  They got my girlfriend's and we have the same nook, that came with same firmware, that was flashed with same mod.  The only thing I can think of was AVG must have stopped it.  They got hers weeks ago and mine is still fine.  She wasn't running AVG and mine was.  It's the only thing I can think of.Who else does that?  I have items from Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, HTC (Sprint), etc and NONE of them update my property.  Who do these people think they are? Well, they won't be updating my firmware and now I won't be buying books from them either.  Anyway, it's an aging piece of hardware and now for a bit more money something better can be bought.Side Note:  I had ordered a touchpad from B&N; back on AUgust 21st.  Not only did I not get one, they cancelled my order for me without so much as an email.  Not very nice.,

8,"Update 2-Sep-13:Put on CM 10.2.2 (Android 4.2.2) last week.  I've got to say, it's nice.  Fonts are small, though one could choose dpi if they had visual issues (google this).  Netflix works, and the UI is really quite nice - pretty much no need for Button Savior, battery life is same as CM7.  In general I like it better than CM7.  My major hardware dislikes are headphone jack requires a little wiggling sometimes, no BT, no GPS.  Seems to charge fine with a normal cable.At this point I lean toward Samsung tablets - I like the IR and the microSD slot.===========================Update Jul 2012: I've installed Cyanogen 7, which works with button savior.  I had trouble installing from .zip booting into recovery but was able to install without a hitch using a bootable microSD card.  Fonts are sometimes a bit big, as is line spacing, but in general, CM7 frees you of the B&N; walled-ness, even as somewhat mitigated below.  Netflix doesn't work, and Google Chrome won't run on Android 2.3.  Headphone jack a bit intermittent - need to wiggle wire sometimes.===========================Original review, Dec. 2011.===========================First I give a summary, followed by the details if U are interested.  I hope people will read reviews here, as, if you say much at all on B&N;'s site, they don't post your review and don't allow you to modify it so that U can post it!:A Nook Tablet could be quite good if you only want to:-  Read ebooks purchased from B&N;-  Browse the web on a tablet-  Play a small selection of games, having to pay 3-4X normal Android/Apple pricesGet something else or modify it if U want to:-  Buy a full selection of games/apps-  Pay the same price for a game as U would on an iPhone/iPad, Android Phone buying from either the Android Marketplace or Amazon App Store.-  Play music where U can sort by artist, album, genre, etc.-  Play mpeg videos-  Watch YouTubeIf U are willing to do a bit of work, you can do all this by modifying the device.  I used it rooted with the modifications described below for 11 months, before installing Cyanogen 7.2 on it.  This is a huge improvement over rooted with the below modifications - it's essentially a normal 7"" Android tablet now.The Details:============My daughter got a Nook Tablet for Christmas 2011.  She'd been saving for an iPad (~$500) but at the rate she was saving, we took pity after a year and a half.While she does read (and so do us parents), she also wanted to use it as a music player, and a movie watching device while away from wireless in the car, on a plane, etc, and she wanted to play some games.I did my reading and we seriously considered an iPad for the family with each of our 2 kids putting in $150 or so.I read about the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet - the Fire only had 8GB of onboard storage at the time, and no micro SD slot.  A deal-breaker.  This was pre Samsung GalaxyTab, Nexus, etc.  Since the Nook Tablet has 16GB and a micro SD slot, we went to a store to take a look.  Sales guy was good, and the device hardware shows well.  Once we got it home and were doing more reading about setup, we found the first of our issues:Issue #1: Onboard Memory========================Of the 16GB of storage, you can only place your own items in 1GB.  The rest is for B&N-purchased; content.  1GB is not enough for a music collection, or any significant amount of video.  A 32GB Class 4 micro-SD card was also in her stocking, having read about this ahead of time.Once she unwrapped it and we set it up (easy enough), annoyance #2 showed itself:Issue #2: App prices and quantity=================================2 Examples: Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja.-  BN Market: $2.99, $3.95.-  Amazon's Android Market: $0.99 (ad-free), with free ad-supported versions available-  Android Market, $0.99 for either, plus free, ad-supported versions available.-  Apple App Store, $0.99 and $0.99, plus free, ad-supported versions available.YouTube: free/pre-installed on all Android/Apple phones/tablets I know of, not available on the Nook Tablet, not in the Nook store.I didn't buy either game, but instead looked back to some of my pre-Christmas reading - U can load Amazon's Appstore without rooting the device, esp. if it's running v1.4.0 of the software.  I got that working and bought $0.99 ad-free Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds.  While I was at it, I side-loaded a few other apps by e-mailing them to myself and web-browsing to get them, and got usb drivers working on an XP laptop so I could sideload via adb over usb.I wasn't home for Christmas, but I did have my work laptop which has music on it.  I copied some over and began to use the music player....Issue #3: Built-in Music Player Limitations===========================================The built-in music player in Android is decent - has been since Android 1.5 - the first version I used.  U can, generally, sort by artist, album, etc, and the UI has dark backgrounds rather than white.  The Nook built-in music player doesn't allow sort. For this, I didn't want to buy a music player, so I went ahead and rooted the device and installed Honeycomb's (Android 3.0's) music player, which is free.  Also put the standard Android YouTube app on since I could now access the Android Market.  The problem wasn't quite solved, because changes to the SD card (adding files) weren't recognized.  I tried Winamp, Songbird and Android 4.0's music player when ICS came out.  They had the same issue.  TTPod does work - you can manually refresh at any time.  I now run Cyanogen, whose music player (modified stock android to add gesture support) works just fine.  They were aware of tablets when they wrote it.This is ironic - B&N; had to do actual work to make it much worse than using the normal android version, plus they had nice opportunities to improve on the experience of a phone due to the large screen - Cyanogen 7 Android supports gestures for music - do an arrow to the left like ""&lt;"", say, and it'll go back a track.  This would be great while driving.(Note that U can unroot by putting a copy of 1.4.0 on an SD card which, though I'm not sure, would probably allow you to return the device if U needed to).Issue #4: Built-in Video Player Limitations===========================================I'd also brought on my work laptop half a dozen videos I nabbed from our TiVos from which I stripped the commercials, saving them as mpg videos.  These wouldn't play with the built-in player.I solved this with MX Player, free version, which plays them fine. U can do this only if U've installed Amazon's App Store or rooted and can access the Android Market. People out there are selling PC software to convert videos to a format Nook Tablet can use. No need - just get another video player.  MX Player Tip: brightness control is an up/down swipe on the left hand side of the screen, volume on the right.Issue #5: UI Inflexibility==========================U can't add shortcuts to the desktop, and can't do much with the sliding apple-style bar either.  For this, I installed App Manager (tough to find a .apk to sideload using adb, so I needed rooting and then got it from Android Market).  This is a fantastic app and I don't use my GoLauncher screen much any more.Also, there's one physical button.  Standard android buttons such as menu (right-click) and back aren't always around in the UI, and holding home doesn't bring up a list of open applications as it does in carrier or stock android.  They should have put those standard 2 buttons on the device.  Update after a month rooted: use Button Savior, which gives soft buttons with a flyout.  Once in a while, you have to use NT Hidden Settings to check USB Debugging unless you use Cyanogen.  Update post Cyanogen: CM7 can have soft buttons (back, menu, home, etc) displayed all the time, if desired, and has Button Savior installed as well.Issue #6: Can only charge with their charger/cable==================================================Nothing more to say.  BlackBerries and Android phones in the house all can charge in the car or at all the computers by just connecting a cable.  It charge very slowly, even if it doesn't tell you it is, when connected to a PC because or other charger.  With some irony, B&N; has had to mail me both a charger and a cable this year due to breakage.  If they could charge with any micro-USB cable, they wouldn't have to.  Update post-Cyanogen: With Cyanogen, it charges with any micro-USB cable, though slowly unless it's the actual Nook stuff - there must be something in hardware.Issue #7: OTA update breaks all the niceness I've achieved==========================================================An OTA update, v1.4.1, will break the ability to mail yourself .apks to be used to enable non-BN apps to install and to enable debugging.  I imagine U could have done these steps while on 1.4.0 and gotten sideloading via PC/adb to work, but U can't disable OTA updates.  U can if you root, though, so I did, then used SQLite to modify a setting to only update when done manually. It'll never auto-update.  Update post-Cyanogen: irrelevant now.Goodness #1: Hardware is pretty sweet=====================================Snappy, installs apps fine, opens them quickly, videos are fairly smooth, scrolling is pretty good (but not as nice as Apple's).Screen is great from angles, clear and bright.It's lightweight and can be held easily in one hand.Speaker is pretty loud - louder than any of our phones except maybe BlackBerry.Goodness #2: the Reading Aspect===============================The reading end of the device is well-implemented, though I give Amazon's original Kindle and all subsequent ones and advantage - an order of a book on an original kindle appeared on the device in less time than it took me to back out of the purchase UI.  Doing so from the web is also very fast.  A web order using a computer of a B&N; sample appeared about an hour later, but quite snappily when done from the device.Goodness #3: Books with Videos/Sound====================================Yes, these are available on Kindle Fire and iPads. I know. I do like the talking kid's books (reminds me of a LeapFrog Tag pen, but without the ability to touch words and hear them), and the free cookbook sample had a video of making a chocolate sauce.  This is good for cooking!  U can see what each stage is supposed to look like.Goodness #4: Good if U Root it, for $250========================================When rooted, it's a nice tablet + it has the B&N; connection, and it cost $250.  It isn't an iPad (no cameras or BT), and it's half the price.  Update Nov 2012: There are now a multitude of 7"" tablets (ASUS, Samsung, Google) which get my recommendation.,
",".Paid $[...] for this in April 2010.  Biggest waste of money I ever spent.  not worth the hassle of getting it repaired.  Made me miserable and unhappy for three days.  This is not how I want to spend my life--feeling miserable and abused and wondering how I got suckered into this huge mistake.The good--or perhaps the OK--I found nothing really good.GSM service is free for purchasing books and most uses. Not all that valuable.  I'd be happy with just WiFi and enough memory to carry around a personal library. with me.  GSM available for anything else but books.  Wifi works ok, after some fussing with the settings.  Many times I got error messages.  I kept trying until it worked.  There is some issue with the Wifi but it can be fussed with until it works--starting and stopping it.The bad--just about everything:I travel a lot, and need to carry my library with me.  This device does not work to download books outside of the US.  Why not?  I can understand the GSM not working, but if I have WiFi access somewhere, I should be able to load anything I want anywhere.  I can load books anywhere with my iPod Touch. Requires a US address.  Why?  Why can't anyone use it?  Device requires that you sign up with B&N; with a credit card.  Why can't I download free books without a B&N; account?  You cannot use this device until it is registered.This device is barely functional.  The interface is poorly designed, B&N; does a great job of making it difficult to find free books, and the books that are normally free--B&N; charges you $1 to $2 for these books! Outrageous!  Most people would not have a clue they are being ripped off being charged for books in the public domain.The interface is so bad that everyone is hacking these devices to make them functional.  Do a GOOGLE search for nook soft root--better yet check out YouTube and search for TROOK.Do a search on nook itself for free and you won't find free books, you will find books with ""free"" in the title or crippled editions with two chapters free.  There is no menu selection for find free books.  If you do find a free book it will be after wading through page after page of the same title--it would take days to find even a few interesting free books.  With the Kindle, at least you get to choose a few best sellers are part of your purchase price.  The B&N; give you nothing for free but garbage.  They want to frustrated enough to pay them more money for overpriced books.  Personally I can't see paying the same price for an electronic book as I do a paper bound book that I can resell or give as a gift.  Electronic books cost nothing to produce and distribute--why do they cost so much?  It is gouging, IMHO.To get a free book into your nook is a nightmare PITA.  I use an iPod Touch and was able to load 60 free books into it, in about 8 minutes--easy and simple.  Not menu after menu and then find out the book was not loaded after all.With B&N; nook it takes a long time to select and load a book.  You have to pay for a book, even if it is zero dollars--another menu choice, just to get you in the habit of hitting a purchase button.  There are lots of free books out there.  Why should it be hard to load these? Personally, I want a large library with me because I travel alot, and I want to find  what I want quickly, and I want to read it without hassle.PFD files can be loaded but these are not re-sized, so that type is pretty small and hard to read.  I can't read them, and I have reasonably good near vision.  If you are young with perfect vision you might be able to read for a while until your eyes get tired.  PDF don't work well on this device.Changing a page is a pain with the controls.  There is a way to use a finger swipe that some people have difficulty with.I personally hate wading through 40-60 pages on the life of the author, at the beginning of the book when all I want to do is read the book itself.  Books with a ton of crap in the front, with articles about the life of the author, acknowledgments, are a PITA toget around.  Scrolling down to chapter one to start the book is problematic--sometimes you are sent back to the index, other times you go to Chapter one. Why should I have to scroll and enter a command twice.  Why can't it work the first time?I constantly had the urge to use the white part of the device as a touch screen, but only the bottom is a touch screen.  I found myself thinking, my iPod Touch is better than this.  It is fast to touch what I want.  Give me something better like a Blackberry pointer ball!Display is flashing every time a page is changed.  I found this constantly annoying.  Why?  There is no reason for the flashing.  EVERY PAGE FLASHES AT YOU!  YOU WILL LEARN TO HATE IT!!!!USB power connector.  This is a weak spot of the device.  Instead of using a robust connector, they use a micro USB connector. It is wobbly. Even a mini-USB would have been better.  At times I  could not make this connector work.  It is delicate.  It doesn't want to mate up.  I found I needed to be very precise on aligning it, even then it would not connect.  I doubt that this will survive 100 re-connections.  If you buy this device, do not expect it to last more than two years.  It would be smart to get the extended warrantee--another $60 for two years--If you buy a nook.  Charge it only when you have too, or you will wear out this connector in a short period of time.  While the battery life is good, given the crappy connector, I don't understand why they didn't put a battery 2-3 times larger in this device so that the connector would last longer and have less wear.Memory Storage is limited to about 1GB with space to add another memory card.  To bring it up to 8 or 16 GB, it will cost you another $30 to $60, or if you buy it from B&N; it will be twice as much.  I feel the device is worthless without at least another 8GB of storage.  I'd rather it came with another 16GB.  The iPad comes with that much or more--so you get a color full touch screen for not much more than the cost of the memory you need.This is a good gift for someone clueless about electronics that won't know any better about how badly B&N; crippled their android operating system and don't understand what a good interface is all about.Do yourself a favor.  Try an iPod Touch, and I assume the iPad works as well.  Apple makes quality products that work right, with strong connectors, great software, and are backed up with the highest rated customer support.  B&N; built something with one purpose only, to sell electronic books--and to make it difficult to find free books, and to break quickly.  If you want to be screwwed over, buy one of these and then bend over because B&N; sees you as someone to be used and abused--not a valuable customer.If B&N; made it easy to download free books, I'd be more forgiving on the crappy software they use and the delicate power connector.  If B&N; made a decent, usable interface, and made it easy to load whole library's of free books, I'd probably buy some electronic books and they would earn my business.  As it is, I will never buy an e-Book or any other book from B&N.;  That is how angry I am about wasting money on this product.My nook is dead after only three days.  I wish I could return it.  I don't have the original packaging either, so that even if I got a new replacement, I cannot sell it on eBay to get my money back.  I'm not sure what I'll do.  I will be calling B&N; tomorrow to see about a replacement, and begging for a store credit instead so I can buy an iPad instead.The bottom line is, I'm more than disappointed about the product.  I'm angry enough that I'll never do business with B&N; again--even if they refund me the price of this device.  I don't even want it back if it were repaired.I'd rather pay $600 for an iPad, purchasing from a company that charges a lot for products that are well thought out and work well.  While I may wish the price was less for Apple products, at least I don't have this awful feeling of being screwwed ten different ways by B&N; with their service and nook product.For those who think this is a good product.  You are fools who don't know enough to make a valid judgment.  I laugh at you, because your nook will be dead within a year.,
","The new Nook ""Simple Touch"" is easy on my eyes for long reading sessions.  The Nook makes it easy to chose a font style, a font size, single spacing or double spacing...you can customize the appearance of the text to your needs.It is easy to read the Nook indoors with any decent room lighting, and easy to read outdoors in the shade.  It is July in Texas...so I have not tried using it in direct sunlight.The Nook is easy and comfortable to hold in one hand for extended periods of time.  Turning pages is easy with a light touch on the side of the screen or a press of the page button in the sideframe.The battery took a couple of full charge/discharge cycles to stabilize. At that point, it was using about 2% of the battery for each hour or two of reading.  Reading an hour or two hours a day and using the Wi-Fi an hour or two per week would result in 3 weeks or 4 weeks per charge.  In contrast, my color e-reader requires charging each day.Magazines look MUCH better on my color e-reader, but magazine text is very readable on the Nook.  The Nooks is at its best with a book with plain text, as illustrations, art, drawings, etc. look crude compared with a color e-reader.I have several books in paperback at home that I also have on the Nook.  Because I can increase font size and use double-spacing on the Nook, it is much easier to read on the Nook than in the paperback book.  My aging eyes feel much better after a couple hours with the Nook than after a couple hours straining to read the ""fine print"" that is typical of lower priced paperback books.If you want an e-reader primarily for magazines, you probably should buy the Nook Color or a small color tablet.  If you will be reading books, you will like the NOOK Simple Touch. Look around and compare price...the price of the Nook varies widely between stores.,

9,"The Nook HD was designed to be a book reader, although it also is a great way to watch videos on Netflix, or listen to Pandora Radio, or to your favorite music. I added a 32gb memory card so that I can have thousands of my favorite songs with me when I travel.The Nook HD has a screen with the best resolution and the least glare and reflection of any color e-reader.  It is the only color e-reader that comes close to the reading experience of an e-ink reader.Barnes & Noble has lots of children's books that take advantage of the Nook's color and audio features.  I bought a Christmas story that can read out loud in English or Spanish, and on each page something would be moving...snow falling, or the moon moving across the sky.The Nook is VERY light, which makes it easy to read for hours, and you don't mind having your Nook with you 24/7 in your purse or ""man purse"" (I use a small laptop bag).The Barnes & Noble selection of e-books is huge, and includes 90% of best sellers.  Each day, there is a ""Book of the Day"" for $2 or $3...many of them best-sellers or classic books.,
","After MONTHS of research for my first ereader I finally decided on the Nook. With all the buzz, I, of course, ran out to BN to see the Nook when it first came out and was incredibly disappointed at that time as it was painfully sluggish and I had almost crossed it off my list for purchase. However, I went back and saw it again at the store after about 6 weeks from my first viewing and what a difference! Barnes and Noble has made great strides. A friend showed me her Kindle and I got to play with it and I looked in stores and saw the Sony reader as well. Did MUCH research online as well on some of the others such as Jetbook Lite.As much as I LOVE Amazon and shop here more often than I probably should LOL. I decided on the Nook seeing the improvements that were already made in that short amount of time. What sealed the deal for me was the SD card option to expand memory AND you can change the battery yourself as opposed to having to send your device back over a simple battery change.I am not regretting my decision to go with the Nook at all. I have to admit that it did freeze up on me twice, BUT it only did that when I interrupted the charging process. So, I don't know exactly what caused that. No problems at all while reading. As far as reading on the Nook, its a great device. Downloading books is fast and simple to do. Page turning is fast now. Its a dream come true for an avid reader like me.The only con that I've noticed so far is battery life. I think its a huge stretch to say the battery lasts 10 days. However, the wi-fi turns itself off after being idle for a minute or so, so you don't have to manually turn it off. When you activate the menu, it will reconnect to the network. So, BN is making an effort to increase battery life without much manual interaction.I highly recommend the Nook. With BN updates coming as quick as they are, I think this device is proving to be THE superior ereader.,
","I just received this reader after returning a gifted Kindle.  Nice screen and seems much more white than the Kindle Touch I returned.  I did root it to run Android, so it tends to lag in apps that it was never meant to run, but in reader apps, it's great.  It also has a micro SD slot (32GB works fine) which is the main reason I chose it.  That and the fact that it is so easily rooted, with a large support community.  I liked the Kindle's sleek looks more than the Nook, but the screen on this is definitely better for reading (can't speak for the new Kindle Paper White).  I haven't read outdoors with it yet, so no info there.  Now I have a ton of ebooks and, more importantly, all my college text books in PDF format.  In fact now that it's rooted, I can read any format file by getting an app (including the Kindle app!).  Web browsing is okay with Opera mobile.  Email is great.  Video is not possible, but eink offer a couple of months of battery life (even a few weeks would be great) which makes up for any shortfalls.  I leave my laptop home most days now.  Bottom line: It's the perfect addition to the modern student's toolkit (If you've got a little technical know-how).,

10,"I've owned an Ipad 2, an original Kindle Fire, and first generation 3g dual screen Nook. I decided it was time to upgrade my original Nook and went with this tablet. I purchased mine direct from B&N. This is a fantastic ereader with a few tablet functions. I really like the interface on this ereader more so than the Kindle Fire. Don't get me wrong, the Kindle Fire is a very nice device, but I like the personal touch I can give the Nook HD. It's more customizable.I can create my own wallpaper and customize my home screen. The ereader is very light and easy to hold with a contoured, grippy back. The screen resolution is fantastic! Even small print is readable. The colors in magazines is exceptional and the scrapbook feature is an innovative touch. I really appreciate having a physical home button, and external volume rockers & power button. The interface is very user friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Setting up email was a snap and customizing my security settings from lock screen passwords to shopping passwords is much appreciated. Web browsing is very zippy on this device. More zippy than the Kindle Fire. Ereading is also a pleasure, with customizable fonts & backgrounds. I was surprised at how well I was able to read on it outside in the shade. It still has a lot of glare, but it is much more readable than the Ipad or the Kindle Fire.I can't see the Ipad or Kindle Fire screen at all outside with all the glare. Nook HD is NOT as readable as an eink screen, so I will be keeping my original Nook of 3 years for outdoor reading. But for a tablet ereader, I was really surprised at how well it did outside in the shade. I have since given my husband the Ipad 2, as I like the 7"" form factor of the ereader/tablet devices. I take them with me everywhere. If you were to ask me which I liked better, the Kindle Fire or the Nook HD...well...I wouldn't be able to choose. Amazon has a larger store for books, apps, movies etc....but I like B&N's Nook HD for it's interface, superb screen and customizable home screen. It also has expandable memory, and you can sideload epub books. I also like the look of the Nook HD better. It would come down to personal preference and which store you have the most investment with. All in all, the Nook HD is a great device that hasn't gotten the attention it deserves, and is worth serious consideration.,
","I will continue to update this review as I discover new features of the Nook, so stay tuned folks!*****************************************************************************Updated 02/08/2010*****************************************************************************I've been using my Nook with the newest update (v 1.2) for a few days now.  This is the second update to the Nook since launch.  All I can say is THANK YOU Barnes & Noble!The LCD screen improvements alone are GREAT!  With better looking icons, more responsiveness, and a sleeker appearance -- it makes me think of that McDonald's commercial: I'm lovin' it!Several of the well documented issues have been fixed, such as losing bookmarks due to powering off the unit -- which as it turns out was the most cited problem for Nook bashers and haters alike.  Nook haters will also be disappointed that the battery life has been optimized too.All-in-all if you've been waiting for the minor 1.0 issues to be fixed prior to purchasing the Nook you will not be disappointed in this newest version.  And if you have been considering switching from the Kindle you would be well advised to do so at this point.*****************************************************************************Updated 01/31/2010*****************************************************************************This device is clearly the best option on the market today, with it's LCD touchscreen, Wi-fi, memory expansion capabilities, and so, so much more. Let's ""wade in the weeds"" and look at some of the features in detail:LCD TouchscreenSo far this is the only mainstream reader to offer a LCD screen of any kind. The Coverflow-like book cover listing is beautiful, elegant, and functional. With the newest update it is uber fast, intuitive, and responsive. Page turns are super easy with the touchscreen, all you have to do is swipe the screen with one finger when it's in standby mode and the page turns.  In addition, it's easier for me to navigate books via the LCD than textually. Seeing the cover is a really nice feature, since books are designed to pique your interest by the cover. It just seems like a good cover sells a book, and seeing that cover in crisp LCD sells me from time to time.The keyboard is nice, any time a text field comes up you will have the keyboard pop up on queue. It's fast, responsive, and best of all doesn't look like a 1970's era fax machine keypad like some of the older readers on the market.Wi-fiThe built in Wi-fi is one of the great features of this device. Modern 3G speeds are pretty fast, but as most of us know that have smartphones, Wi-fi is about 100 times faster, especially when one tries to download large things, or a lot of content. The Wi-fi on this device is no exception... it's fast and super easy to set up. The on screen instructions are sooo clear to follow. I couldn't imagine only having 3G these days, like when you are in an area that doesn't have 3G coverage, you can still use the Nook over Wi-fi.  This is truly one of the killer features of the Nook.  You can go into a B&N; store and Wi-fi to your hearts content, but then come home and do the same.  Hotels offering free Wi-fi are the Nooks biach.Memory ExpansionThe Nook has a Micro-SD card slot which accepts up to 16GB Micro-SD cards, this allows you to upgrade your memory indefinitely. Another advantage would be to organize your books. And books on the card are never going to get lost if your reader dies -- without having to re-download from the cloud.  Plus with the new B&N; desktop reader you can move your books from the Nook to a laptop/netbook on the fly, and what if the worst should happen and your eReader dies?  You still have those books on the card.AppearanceThis is a biggy for me as it is for most people... I don't tend to buy or use things that look ugly. That's why I've got an iPod instead of a Zune, why I've got a LCD TV instead of a CRT, and now why I've got a Nook instead of another reader. The appearance of this device can be described with one word, SEXY. It just looks good. Other readers currently available range from looking ""not too bad"" to looking downright ugly. This reader is the exception to that rule and employs a host of features to boot.Book formats and availabilityThis is probably the biggest of all the features, since we are talking about a book reader, the Nook boasts a whopping 1,000,000 books available for it, in readily readable format, from just two sources (B&N; and Google). The nearest competitor only offers 500,000 books in it's native format (Kindle). You can convert many books to a Kindle readable format, but it's a hassle and you have to use your computer to do that. Sort of defeats the purpose of the wireless if you have to constantly connect to the PC. And there are third party sources for books in Kindle format, probably websites you've never heard of, new sites pop up all the time since Kindle has a big install base, but the quality of books on those sites is in question compared to a reputable company like Google.eInk displayIt seems to be crisper than much of the competition out there. The ability to change the typeface and size of the fonts is wonderful. The nearest competitors screen almost seems fuzzy in comparison, which for me makes it harder to read. Page changes are fast on the Nook, while nothing can compare with the speed of changing a real books' page, it's fast enough for the average person. Speed readers may find themselves waiting for a few milliseconds though. The controls on the Nook are straightforward and intuitive.Replacable batteryThis is another biggy for most ebook people, with the Nook you can change the battery out should you A) want extended reading times without charge, or B) if the original battery dies for some reason.  Many of the other readers on the market do not allow this, which means they are bricked if the battery dies and will either have to be repaired or replaced.Battery lifeA lot has been said about the battery life of the Nook, and other eReaders.  All of the manufacturers of these devices overstate the real world battery life in real world useage situations.  I have a co-worker with one of the Amazon (Kindle Brand) eReaders and he has to charge every 3 - 4 days.  Nook lasts for me about 5 - 7 days, but it all depends on what features you use on either or any of the devices and how much you use them to determine actual, real world battery usage. Either way, all of these devices are easy to charge.  Just plug into a standard 110 - 120 outlet and PRESTO!  Or in the case of the Nook, you can also plug into your computer/laptop/netbook and VOILA!  You will be on go in no time flat.Ease of useThe Nook is easy to set up and use, The onscreen keyboard is more familiar and similar to modern devices than many of the competitors setups.SummaryThere are so many features of this device it's hard to capture them all in one review. All in all this is one great device, with it's iPod like look and feel, large number of built in features, and industry standard operating system, it's clearly the choice of discerning electronics customers.*******************************Update*******************************So, I had been told on these comments that the B&N; in store functionality was not ready to be used yet -- another lie dispelled today.  I stopped in at the B&N; in Hillsboro and it is in fact fully functional.  My Nook immediately recognized the B&N; network and connected without me even having to tell it to!  As it turns out there is exclusive content at each B&N; store, at this particular one there were multiple books that could be downloaded for FREE!!!  So, seeing one that piqued my interest I naturally downloaded it.  Wow, super fast and convenient, and FREE!,
","I'll admit up front that when I chose the Nook over Kindle and Sony's e-reader, I was impressed by that nifty full color touchscreen at the bottom of reading screen.  Glitz does not equal function, as I promptly found out.To be fair to Nook, if ALL you want to do is read, the device works, and works pleasantly.  I received my Nook in February, so it had the latest firmware updates, and I experienced none of the delays in downloading, missed sections of books, delays in page turning that early reports noted.  But if I was attempting to do anything more than clicking the page turning buttons, OUCH!The nifty little full color touchscreen (NOT to be confused with the e-paper reading screen, which is permanently gray-scale) just can't do it's job.  It responds slowly and inconsistently to touch, is quirky in its response, and virtually (no pun intended) unusable.  The virtual keyboard:  what a nightmare.  It's a true challenge to type more than one or two words without making an error, and trying to fix that error degenerates into a tragi-comedy in short order.The unit itself is pleasant to the hand, and comfortable.  It's also darn slick in its appearance, and if aesthetics  are your only criteria, well, go for it.  But here is why I returned the Nook after one week:  any optional feature, such as bookmarking, highlighting text and annotating it, search functions for previous book marks and annotations:  purely a nightmare.  The processor of the Nook appears to be vastly underpowered, and each instruction you give the touchscreen results in a wait that seems interminable.  It took me 30 seconds, AFTER I got good at it, to highlight 3 lines at the bottom of a page.  Simply not acceptable.Battery life:  might have just been my own unit, but in 7 hours: dead.  I also experienced two full scale lockups, with all buttons simply refusing to work for several minutes.The Nook's only advantage, as far as I can tell, is access to significantly more free content than you can currently access on Kindle.  Not worth the incredible frustration of wrestling with a device that went for touchscreen technology, but forgot that the touchscreen needs to be FUNCTIONAL before you bring it to market.Update as of 2/11/2010:  I purchased a Kindle after returning my Nook, and have been using it for three days.  Wow.  What an incredible difference in terms of ease of use.  The keyboard is very functional, bookmarking and note taking is effortless, the dictionary function (move the cursor to a word, instantly a definition pops up) is wonderful. Battery consumption is imperceptible, after 3 day, no visible drain (my Nook lasted 7 hours).  Downside of the Kindle?  Books whose copyright had expired (e.g. Wuthering Heights)that were FREE on Nook, are 99 cents on Kindle.  Nook lists all vendors of a given book, with prices conveniently visible, Kindle does not.  Irritating.  Lastly, Nook had a tiny clock in a corner of the screen, which I found very useful.  Not available on Kindle.  Overall:  for my needs, no contest whatsoever: Kindle,

11,"The Nook HD is my third Nook device. I like the Nook simple Touch, Nook Tablet because I primarily use it to read books, watch an occasional video (YouTube), listen to music on Pandora, and work a cross-word puzzle or play a game. Because I enjoyed my Nook so much, I decided to purchase the Nook HD because it is much lighter in weight and more compact in size. Now that I have purchased the Nook HD I have some pros and cons about the product. Nothing serious, I will give myself a little more time to get used to it. But I am concerned about the short battery life.Pros: Light weight and smaller than the previous tablet; great video picture quality and the sound is very good even without the earbuds.Cons: I have to get used to the new interface, the previous tablet was easier to use and navigate; when playing games and connecting to the web using wi-fi, I have to charge frequently because it uses up the battery very quickly&#8212;I may have to carry my charger with me; not as many fonts to choose from like the previous tablet.Overall, I am pleased with my Nook HD Tablet. Once I have resolved some of the cons with this product, I will be a little more comfortable with using it on a daily basis.,
","I got the Nook the day before Nook Color was announced. I actually waited until the Nook Color was announced before opening the box - I wanted to see what the new gadget had to offer and if it'd be worth trading mine in.There were some rumors that the Nook Color would feature a screen with Mirasol technology, and I was disappointed to learn that it actually had an LCD screen coated with something to reduce glare. I state at an LCD screen all day at work, and don't want to do the same while reading. Plus, I'm not sure how well the LCD screen would fare in the sun and I'm interested to hear feedback from Nook Color owners.I think the color screen matters if you want to read a lot of magazines, or textbooks, or kids' books, none of which I'll be doing. Nook Color also stores more books (6000) and allows the reader to send updates to Facebook and Twitter directly from the eReader. Personally, I didn't find any of these extra features particularly appealing, so I'm happily sticking with the original Nook.My Observations/Pros of the Nook-It's bigger than I expected, in a good way. It's not heavy, but has a nice ""significant"" feel to it.-I think few people realize how clear and book-like the e-Ink screen actually is. I showed the Nook to some friends, and that was the first thing they noticed.-The bottom LCD touch-screen adds a little oomph with the color buttons and book covers.-Getting ePub books from the public library has been surprisingly easy, although you have to connect the Nook to a computer in order to transfer the ePub files.-I've been enjoying the Nook Facebook group where administrators post a free eBook every Friday.-The instructional videos online are very helpful in getting started with the Nook.Cons-BN.com has a Free NookBooks section, but for some reason, not all the free eBooks are listed. I saw some Kindle titles that were available for free, and when I searched on BN.com, turns out they were free there as well.-I didn't care much about the LendMe feature of the Nook, but it was still disappointing to learn that not all purchased eBooks can be lent out. Publishers control which titles can be used for lending, and each book can only be lent out once....ever.-The PDF manual for the Nook is very confusing and can benefit from some serious editing.-There are definitely more Kindle books than NookBooks available, but I hope that will change in the near future.All in all, I am pretty happy with the Nook and I think the fact that it supports a wider range of eBook formats outweighs many of the cons. I like not being tied down to one proprietary format and being able to check out eBooks from the library is priceless to me.,
","I am still waiting for the perfect ebook reader. I bought the Nook for these reasons: 1) It reads industry-standard ePub-format ebooks, 2) it's tightly integrated with the B&N; ebook store, 3) the ebooks are encrypted in a well-documented easily-understood format that is portable across multiple devices so they can be decrypted and read in, say, your iPad's Nook reader software, or even in a Sony Reader (with the very latest firmware), without having to be re-purchased because of DRM nonsense.The problem is that the Nook simply doesn't live up to its promise. The ""paper-white"" display is more an off-beige, and reflects light in a way that makes it hard to read with a reading light (necessary because it has no backlight, as is true for all ePaper devices). It's heavy and the buttons to change pages are hard to push, especially with gloved hands as you might have while reading outdoors on a cool day. The ""5 day battery life"" in reality for me has been a 1-day battery life, read a book, and it needs to be recharged, and be darn sure to turn it off. The thing freezes up and crashes all the time even with the very latest software, and is excruciatingly slow even with the very latest software. The latest software added classifications for the ebooks so you could sort them into pseudo-folders, which is necessary given how excruciatingly slow the Nook is to scroll through its book list (get about 50 books on the list and you're in for major pain), but the clunky way they implemented this makes those of us who've gotten used to modern user interfaces frown and shake our heads.Sad to say, I really can't recommend any current eBook reader. Either they're too clumsy to use (Nook), have no books available for them (Sony), or have a proprietary eBook format that locks you into a single vendor (Kindle). I'm seriously considering buying an iPad, yes, it will only work for 9 hours or so on a battery charge, but that's true of the Nook too in real actual use and the iPad is usable for a lot of other things too. It's just disappointing that I can't get an ePaper-based reader that meets my criteria (non-proprietary ebook format, long battery life, compact, decent user interface), and instead have things either crippled by bad design decisions or crippled by having a proprietary ebook format that locks you into a single vendor. Well, I don't like crippled, so I'll look elsewhere, thank you very much...,

12,"This is a really nice item. With the way I use it, the battery life lasts for several days of reading and browsing the web. Magazines on this screen are amazing, I especially like reading Time because of the outstanding photography they do. Books look great, and the selection of games on the Barnes and Noble store is alright. A little annoying paying again for games I already bought on my phone, but that's not so bad.Further, you really don't need to pay again for games if you install a custom ROM on an SD card. You can either purchase one premade (google for N2A for more info) or you can burn your own if you google a little more and spend the afternoon trying different things. It's not scary at all, especially since you're only doing stuff on the SD card not the tablet itself. If you want to undo it, just take the card out! Anyway, the custom ROM just gets you stock android, and that opens this great device up to the full android market of games and apps. You can still read all your Barnes and Noble stuff on the B&N; android app. I read my Wired subscription that way, as well as some books. Anyway, I think this device and the ROM on the SD card is the best of B&N; and android.Anyway, I'd compare this with the Google Nexus 7. The nook has a slightly higher resolution screen, which is kinda neat especially for magazines. No front facing camera on the nook, but my phone already is great for video chat so I don't miss it. Also, the custom ROM I put on my SD card is android 4.2, whereas google says the Nexus is android 4.1...maybe they'll get an update soon I don't know. So, either way, you probably can't lose.EDIT: Barnes and Noble opened up the stock software to be able to use almost all of the apps in the google play store. So, I don't use my custom ROM at all, because of the better battery life and just overall fit and finish of the Barnes and Noble stock software. It's a great tablet!,
","I did a lot of investigating before buying this product. I ended up buying it mainly because it was the only one with decent reviews that I could find in stores. However, I am not disappointed at all. The sound isn't quite CD quality but it's pretty darn good and definitely better than a regular tape. I don't have an FM adapter but from what I read, the cassette adapters have a much better sound.The other big bonus is that it doesn't matter which way the larger opening is on your tape deck because this adapter has a latch you can open on the bottom to change the cord over to the other side if needed. Warning, some brand name adapters will only work in tape players facing a certain direction! Every once in a while I have to put the tape in twice for it to work right; otherwise I haven't had any other problems with this and it gives my mp3 player a great sound! Another tip: if you don't have an equalizer on your car stereo or mp3 player, what you can do is adjust the volume on the player and your stereo to balance the bass and treble (for me, if I have the mp3 player sound lower and the car stereo louder, I'll have more treble...and a little more static, too).As an aside, I doubt the product itself was the problem for the person with the bad car speakers who reviewed this product negatively.,
","I already own a Wi-Fi + 3G Kindle and had compared reviews between the Nook and Kindle extensively, before buying the Kindle.  But because the Nook allows you to borrow books from the local library for free, and my wife was hogging the Kindle, I decided to try a Nook, at a reduced price.  While the Kindle is clearly a superior product, (lighter, faster, easier to use and much longer battery life), I found the Nook okay at the price I paid.It was a little difficult to learn how to navigate with the touch screen and the set-up seemed ponderous, but once I got the hang of it, I've borrowed a book a week from the library.  The reduced price for the product was because someone had returned it and it presumably had been repaired.  I haven't found anything wrong with it and it looked new, unscratched and unmarked, so as a back-up to a Kindle, I'd recommend it.  I'm getting about 3-5 days of battery life in ""airplane mode"" (wi-fi and 3G turned off), and that's enough to finish a book without recharging.  I'm not rating reliability, because I've only had it for about a month.,
"
13,"Mixed up the review to show how the Nook changed with Updates within 12 hours of opening the box.Opened the Nook packaging with great anticipation. The instruction set is barely nuts and bolts but it gives one the essentials.It passed the back pocket test famously. This was done straightaway. Was very pleased with this feature.But buyer beware. I discovered this Nook tablet has no camera at all. Who ever heard of such a thing? There is a reasonable expectation.The Nook downloaded and upgraded itself famously. Everything was smooth and cheerful.The speed of the Nook was very good in my opinion. Page to page was smooth and cheerful and moderately fast. The book pages are easy to read. Another Dan Brown book (I think). Made the discovery with Inferno. Played/watched Linux Action Show and other video for about 3 hours with about 15% of the battery power left.Checked YouTube and Amazon to see the how the graphic's engine worked in the Nook. The motion pictures were crisp and clear on YouTube and Amazon. The sound was very excellent and voluminous much to my surprise. Can hear the device clearly and with ease even though I am kinda hard of hearing. The movie scenes moved like a big computer rendering of the graphics. The motion pictures were like a TV broadcast. Not kidding.Now the ultimate bummer: their much touted microSDHC card can not play your own content downloaded from a computer. Later, several hours later there was an additional patch of 75 upgrades that made the microSDHC capable of playing video files/movies. The selection it can play is very limited compared to other more recent operating systems in Android devices. The latest Android operating system is 4.4 KitKat. The Nook will not play certain AVI or HD files. It is very persnickety  What the Nook can play is rendered exceptionally well indeed. It can only play things downloaded from Nooks libraries for sale-wrong as mentioned. I would have never bought this dohickey if I knew thee was no camera natively in advance.One always takes for granted a camera. And their microSDHC is nothing short of a rip-off. Jeez- wrong now.My Chinese Brand X tablets can play my media content in AVI. MP3/4 and other popular media formats very well indeed. These Brand X tablets can play far more movie/video files than the Nook. Their Android versions are newer than the Nook's.The back pocket thing was a real plus. Great sound. Great graphics. Good speed.But these pluses can not counter balance the negatives. The camera is not as important as real robust motion graphics and awesome sound to me. Now I am thinking I will keep this Nook because it does have a viable if not bugged up microSDHC card port capable of music and motion picture replay. Forget file sharing in Android.B&N; needs a No Brainer award for greed and stupidity just like Apple, Kindle and Nexus. Apple, Kindle and Nexus deserve the No-Brainer award more because the Nook's microSDHC does work but has limited compatibility with the files/apps that can play these type of music and movie files.Now I have to go through the hassle of returning this thingamajig. May keep this on the hope there will be patches further to play music and movie files.If you need a camera don't buy this.,
","I've had the displeasure of owning two RCA brand DVD players and neither one made it more than a year before breaking.  I had this DVD player and a Proscan DVD/DIVX (which the salesman at [...] SWORE was the best that money could buy).  The RCA DVD just quit working entirely after 11 months (microprocesor).  My [$] Proscan DVD player now displays a ""NO DISC"" message seemingly at random, and for no particular reason.  Sometimes you can put a disc in and it will play the first time, others you have to try it a few times, and on the worst days you may have to try 15-20 times and it still may not work.In both cases I called RCA, sat on hold for some ridiculous amount of time, spoke to someone in technical support who knew nothing about technical support, and was ultimately told it would cost more to repair than to replace.RCA's warranty is useless, their technical support line is an exercise in futility, and I personally don't think it's worth the money to repair any of their poorly engineered products.  I've learned my lesson with RCA and will specifically avoid their products in the future.,
","Well, I bought it because of the 1080p resolution.  The screen quality is beautiful.  I already have an Apple 4th generation iPad, but I couldn't resist on the high quality picture and low price.  After I received the Nook, I immediately rooted with Kit Kat, the latest operating system.  Let me tell you, I am glad that I made the move.  The original Ice Cream Sandwich OS has lag but not Kit Kat.  With Kit Kat, not only the Nook operates much more smoothly, you also get the full Android tablet experience and more apps available from Google Play.I recently stumbled across the XBMC Cine Player Android app in the Google Play store.  With this app, I can now stream over 1500 movies in HD quality for free.  I have been using XBMC for a little while now on both MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, though the Cine Player version's library is not as extensive as the MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, it is good enough for use when you are on the road like in a hotel or something.  With Kit Kat, I experience very little buffering issue. I can also output contents to a TV via the Nook HDMI adapter.  I believe you can output signal to a TV via Google Chromecast but I haven't tried it yet so I can't be for sure.I highly recommend the Nook if you root it with the latest OS.  I am finding more and more things that I can do with the Nook then the iPad due to Android is an open system.By the way, I use N2A to root my two Nook HD+'s.  With a N2A micro SD card, it gives you the dual boot capabilities.  You can use it to boot Kit Kat or the native Barnes and Noble OS without removing the card.  The N2A card doesn't replace the native OS as the Kit Kat OS is stored in the micro SD card so you don't have to be concerned about voiding the warranty from alternating the tablet OS.Bottom line, the Nook HD+ is already a pretty decent tablet.  One can greatly improve its potential with a simple change to the OS.  If front and back cameras and GPS are not necessities for you, the Nook is a good value tablet for 1/3 of the cost of an iPad.  By the way, I bought an external bluetooth GPS for $16 and it works like a charm with the Nook.  One can expect to spend $100 for an external bluetooth GPS if your IOS device doesn't come with an internal GPS.,
"
14,"The Nook tablet is a great color e-reader with the ""bonus"" of being able to read your email, shop on Amazon.com, surf the web, watch tv shows on Hulu Plus, movies on Netflix, and listen to the world's largest selection of music on Pandora Radio.  I added a 16gb sd card filled with thousands of my favorite songs. But, the Nook is designed to be an ereader...it is not a games tablet, or an IPad.I got my Nook Tablet (8gb version) from Barnes & Noble because of the extra discount I got with my B&N; membership...the price was MUCH less than advertised by most internet venders. I already have a Brand X color e-reader and a Nook Simple Touch reader. My old color reader was hard on my eyes for long reading sessions, the Nook Touch is great for books, but it does not have internet access or play music and magazines don't really work without a color screen.The Nook tablet has very sharp, clear, and contrasty fonts and is very pleasant to read, even for several hours. There is a night mode, and also a sephia mode for reading in bed without bothering anyone else. Magazines look great on its color screen. I listen to music on Pandora while I read, and when I am tired of reading, I can watch a movie on Netflix or a tv show on TV.com. I installed the Dolphin browser which uses tabs so I can switch quickly among various web pages.Vevo music videos look great, but the Nook's speaker is too weak to enjoy music. However, music sounds great through good ear buds and when I plug the Nook into my computer speakers.The Nook is an e-reader, NOT an I-Pad or high powered tablet. It does not have access to Google Play to obtain apps, so you are limited to the apps in the Nook app store. Those apps have been developed just for the Nook and its seven inch screen. The apps in Google Play are mostly designed for the smaller screens of cell phones, while Nook apps are designed just for the Nook.Bottom line: the Nook Tablet 8gb is a terrific way to read books and magazines while enjoying your favorite music (I loaded a 16gb memory card with thousands of my favorite songs...transferring the songs over to the Nook from my laptop was fast and easy).For folks who want the ""full"" tablet experience, Amazon.com sells the N2A card which enables you to boot your Nook into a full tablet mode, with access to Google Play, and the 400,000 apps available there. And, the N2A card also permits booting the Nook back into its original Nook settings, as the card does not modify any of the Nook's software or settings.,
","Being one of those people that likes to chase late-night AM signals, I was convinced that this was a radio I had to have. I was a bit disappointed in some areas, but still see it as something good. This radio is big. Period. Once loaded with ""D"" batteries, it can be used to tone those upper arms during long listening sessions. Quality control seems to vary from set to set, but a few things off the bat that I found were awry for my $50 were:1) Build quality. The switches and dials seemed on the flimsy side, with the chrome finish easy to rub off.2) Dial Markings. For claiming to be a ""DX Machine"", both AM and FM fequency marks are more for wishful thinking than accuracy. Best bet is to find your local stations and re-mark the dial with whiteout or tape and the actual frequency re-written by hand.3) Audio. For using a large woofer,tweeter, and separate bass and treble controls, the audio quality could be better than it is. It still sounds good, but should be better.On the plus side:1) AM reception is fantastic. By turning the radio to null signals, I was able to pick up a small local on 1040 AM near Rochester, NY, then turn it again to cleanly pick up another station on 1040 AM in Salt Lake City. The wide/narrow setting helps greatly in picking stations from the weeds2) FM reception is quite good. Picking up low-power locals and larger 75+ mile stations is no problem for this unit. I didn't realize there were so many FM's around until I purchased this radio3) AC power cord. Fits neatly in the back of the radio (albeit a bit cramped), and having its own power supply instead of an adaptor eliminates any humming while trying to find faint signals.Although not quite as good as its predecessor the SuperRadioII, it does what it is designed to do - allow good reception of AM and FM without any bells or whistles to get in the way.If you can find it discounted, then pick one up and listen away. Otherwise, there are better choices to be found in this price range.,
","Review for Barnes & Noble NOOK HD+A new winner in the ""best value in a mid-size Android tablet"" category.When it was originally introduced at around $270 it was a decent value in a mid-hi range tablet, but limited by the closed B&N; ecosystem.  Now that it is being offered at new prices ($150-180) and has been upgraded to support Google Play Android apps as well as B&N; content, the value proposition is much improved.  (Yes, you will have to be patient and let your Nook HD+ do a couple a major software updates before you can really settle down and enjoy your new toy!  But it's worth the wait.)If you are coming from other Nook devices, you'll feel right at home.  If not, you may be surprised to find the combined ""reader"" and ""Android tablet"" interface pretty nice.  It's well thought out and for the most part works very well.  Take your time and be willing to explore a bit and you'll soon get the hang if  it.  Don't miss the ""Nook Today"" icon which is a clever one, but easily overlooked.  All in all, I was very comfortable with it in a short time and actually find the UI a bit of a refreshing change.  (Occasionally, you have to use the home key instead of just ""back"" but a minor quibble.) [Note: You can ""override"" the Nook UI and install other ""launchers"" but I, personally, felt no need to do so.  But nice to know the option is there if ever needed.]The size is a nice compromise between the smaller units (too small for comfortable long video watching) and the larger units (big, heavy, bulky).  The 8-9"" range seems to be the sweet spot.  The FULL HD (1920x1080 256ppi) screen is gorgeous with great colors and contrast and sufficient brightness.  Videos/movies, YouTube, Photos, Graphics, all look great.  The high quality screen is the big draw here, in my opinion.  Excellent value at the new price point.The size, weight (very light for this size device), slimness, and easy handling are all good points of this tablet.  Some do not like the Nook hole on the bottom left, but I am fine with it.  It gives a bit of orientation, an easy place to grab the tablet, and so on.  The styling looks good to me and the slimness is nice and makes it easy to hold and handle.HD YouTube and Netflix look wonderful.  This is absolutely one of the best tablets for the price if you want to watch Netflix on the go.  I was able to hook up my portable bluetooth speakers without any problems, so the movies sounded great as well.  Bluetooth headphones also worked well as did regular headphones, of course.  The built in speaker(s) is OK, but not sufficient for best music and movie sound quality (as is true with most tablets).The controls are well placed, simple, and easy to use.  The MicroSD card slot is a nice bonus so you can expand your storage easily and is a feature missing from many tablets.  The proprietary charging port is a minus, a standard USB would have been more flexible, but it works well and charges faster.  The handy ""HOME"" button with the Nook logo is very useful and also works well.There are no cameras - and I could care less, but some might.  I'll take the superb screen, great design and build, and other nice features and be happy.  For the techies, it uses 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 proc and 1 GB of RAM.  Not cutting edge, but plenty fast.  Benchmarks I checked were all pretty good and the Nook HD+ is very responsive in use. The back features a nice ""soft touch"" feel that I really like versus many tablets that have a slick back making them prone to being easily dropped.The recent update adds the Chrome browser to the NOOK HD+ and web browsing is snappy and works well.  Everything looks great, of course, on the FULL HD screen and the Chrome browser handles most web pages with aplomb, formatting them nicely for the Nook HD+.  Chrome will also sync and update your bookmarks and such across devices, automatically, which is nice.If you like Barnes & Noble and their books and movie content, then, of course, that is a win for you as well.  It's all here and well integrated.  Plus there are some Nook HD+ specific apps pre-installed and you should prefer them in most cases.  (Note: I made the mistake of updating the Nook Netflix app with the one from the Google Play store -- big No-No!  It did not work at all.  Once I uninstalled it and went back and reloaded the Nook-branded version from the Nook store (free) -- everything worked fine again. I've had this issue with other tablets as well, the Netflix app seems to be very picky and you need the right one for your specific tablet. I had also installed the Android Pandora over the Nook version, but that one worked fine.  So...if you do this and have issues, just uninstall and reinstall from Nook Store/Cloud vs. Google Play Store and you'll be fine.)All of the other Android apps from Google Play that I tried have worked fine.  Pandora, Stitcher Internet Radio, Maps, Amazon MP3, Amazon Kindle (wow! a bit of a surprise!), Gmail, YouTube, etc. all work as expected.  The new openness of the NOOK HD+ is a game changer for the NOOK line, and pushes it way up in the rankings in my opinion.I bought mine at the local B&N; store and there's a lot of help available there if you need it, which is a huge bonus if you are tech challenged and need advice and help locally.  Very friendly staff and great customer service, what a novel concept!  ;)The Nook HD+ is a ""sleeper"" - an often overlooked alternative to other more expensive tablets that can both out perform them and well beat them in value, being available currently at very attractive prices.  A 5 star item for features, design, performance, and value.,
"
15,"If you buy this from a B&N; store, and are a member of B&N;, you can get this for $174, which is cheaper than the 8 gig Fire. If you already are loaded with Kindle books, B&N; foolishly doesn't have a Kindle app, but you can, on Amazon or n2a.com buy an n2a card which allows you to boot your Nook up as a full Android complete with access to the Android Market (or whatever Google is calling it now), and get the Kindle app to accress all your Kindle books.  Since I love the design of the eReader  on the Nook, I use my n2a card only when I want a Kindle book.  I find the B&N; Nook books are usually the same price as Kindle.  Occasionally, Kindle doesn't have a book I want but Nook does.  Also, Nook may not have a book Kindle has.  Also, Nook books have the page perfect series, as well as Enhanced Editions with embedded videos and audio clips, neither of which Kindle has.The Nook has a tab for ""My Stuff"" so you can drag things from your PC to the Nook.  If you want more space for your stuff, you can get any sized san disk for the Nook.  I have a 32 gb one because I transferred about 4,000 pictures to my Nook and am using an app to edit the pictures and then make slide shows of them. Then I'll drag the shows back onto my computer and burn them to disc. Did I mention the Nook is a joy to use? I actually got thre 16gig Tablet but the 8 gig is as fast and has the 11 1/2 hour battery as well as allows the same cards to be added.,
","I purchased these headphones before traveling to Europe for a couple weeks and the headphones worked great.  The sound quality of the phones was good quality and the comfort was very nice.  The battery powered noise cancellation was also a bonus and it worked very well on the airplane as well as on trains.  I used it on both flights with great relaxation and I also used it on the Chunnel and some subways with continued satisfaction.The weight, length of cord, and fold up feature all made these headphones ideal for traveling.Unfortunately they just are not sturdy or durable.  They are made of plastic and feel very fragile.  I was always very worried of breaking them in my bag or when putting them in the storage pouch.  But worse than their structural durability is that the wiring used is exposed to stress when folded up.In other words the cord is pinched when the phones are folded up and this is a terrible design.  After only about a month, one of the wires split and I lost the right headphone completely.  And forget about trying to fix it as it is virtually impossible to remove and repair the wire without destroying the casing.I am very disappointed in the lifespan of these headphones and will not be buying from this company again.  If not for the poor design these would have been great headphones for the price.,
","Having all the iPad models, 9 different Android models, I can say this tablet overall is a bit disappointing. I realize for those that have come from old hardware or new to tablets might believe this is a bit harsh, but keep in mind this is more of a comparison to other options available out there. Granted there are price differences and for price alone, this is a decent deal.The hardware itself is impressive. Bought these for our 4 and 6 years which were upgrading from their Galaxy 2 7"" tablets. The most significant issue with these tablets is the B&N; version of an already outdated Android OS_Ice Cream Sandwich, not the latest Jelly Bean which is far far better. It is very clunky and very slow, not at all snappy by any sense, even with the latest updates. I did buy it as they finally put Play on it which was a requirement for me, but the OS itself is just horrible. It does have a kids profile mods which is very handy as it allows you to limit what your kids can open.Additionally, as this is an 'overlay' OS, it is very limited in terms of options. Sound options are none existent for various task such as switching profiles, etc. Many apps on the Google store will indicate not compatible with this device. I generally ROM my Android devices however CM10 is the only one at this time with any support and that ROM is very very buggy compared to say Frosty ROM which is not available for this tablet. It works, but again, not a smooth integration of a ROM. So really, your stuck with what B&N; puts on it and at this time, it is very slow and clunky. Now you can 'BUY' a card with Jelly Bean on it, but again, pulling off the card is slower vs. internal memory, though it does allow for a very simple method of getting a 'real' Android OS on this tablet and perhaps the best route at this time.For the kids, they still like the tablet, enjoy the better graphics, larger screen, etc. Once going graphics is good, sound is adequate though not great, touch input is good. But for me, I could never use this tablet for serious use. My Asus TF700T is my go to tablet, even over my iPad 4,3,2,etc. At this time I am contemplating just selling these and buy Nexus tablets for the kids instead as it is more a pure Android experience and not hindered by the clunky implementation of an older Android OS. Perhaps if B&N; releases an OS based on Jelly Bean it may improve things.Bottom line, there are far better options in the Android world.PROSGood resolutionTouch is goodGreat balance of size, not large nor small like a 7"" tabletHas Play installedExternal memory card optionCONSB&N; OS is horrible, slow, cluncky, and based on old Ice Cream Sandwich, not Jelly BeanSpeakers are just OKVery limited accessory options compared to even Kindle HD devicesCharger plug is very tight on both of my models. Perhaps it will loosen up over time. Never had a tablet exhibit this in the past.Lack of support from the aftermarket in terns of ROM availability.No cameraOld slow Wi-Fi hardware, and you will notice this. Download speeds compared to my other tablets is very slow.,

16,"Pros:The hardware is nice, I have the 8GB - Its fast, responsive and the screen is beautiful. Great for reading books and netflix. Battery life - Read 'Catching Fire' and 'Mockingjay' on a single charge. Email and web are decent too - nothing special.Cons:The B&N; Nook OS and the B&N; App selection are both terrible. The Nook OS is counter-intuitive and not user friendly, there is no BACK button!? Take a toll of how often you use the BACK button on your phone or android device and you'll realize how annoying the lack of this simple common-place feature is. You can hit the 'N' and go back to home any time - though often I wanted to go Back, not start over. The selection of apps in the app store are laughable. I literally could not find a single app I wanted, even searching apps that they advertise like Comics for nook (not installed? not available?). I found a few apps for $4.99+ that i have downloaded for free on Itunes and Google play (android market).Recommendation:BUY THIS -N2A (TM) - 32GB Nook to Android bootable microSD Card for the Nook ColorTakes the Good hardware of the Nook Tablet and replaces the useless OS with trusted Full Android. Read the reviews, they are all true! Before i bought this card, the nook was basically useless and frustrating - now I have an android tablet and since it is NOT rooted, still have warranty too, though I recommend squaretrade. Check my N2A review for more info.Update: I have had this tablet for over 6 months now and love it. I have had no issues and all my friends and family want one. Note: I use this exclusively with the N2A card in Android mode. N2A recently emailed me with the update from Gingerbread to Jellybean and its working great and their customer service is excellent. I cannot recommend this company/product enough.,
","I have small children who often put fingerprints on our kiddie DVDs.  Typically, I clean them by ""breathing"" on the dirty DVD and using the inside of my T-shirt to wipe clean these DVDs.  However, I began to look for another solution that didn't involve my T-shirt.  This product ... the Allsop CD and DVD fast-wipes looked like a possible solution, so I ordered a pack.After giving them a try, I find they work well ... they don't get the worst of the fingerprints off without a little extra help (or in my case, a ""breath"" on the DVD), but they get about 95 percent of the fingerprints off quickly and easily.  The material is lint free and works as advertised.  20 CD/DVD shaped wipes come per pack.  Being shaped like a DVD is just a gimmick.  I usually fold them in half or quarters before wiping, so if they were square-shaped (and thus had a little more material) it might actually be more helpful than being shaped like a circle.  The instructions say that each wipe can be re-used until it becomes visably dirty or worn, so you can clean multiple DVDs per wipe.Overall, these are a good buy and work well at a reasonable price.  Four stars.,
","I got this because it was pretty decently priced, honestly though seeing how some of the other video capture devices out there were upwards of $60 I wasn't expecting much.  When I got, I was rather surprised how well it worked.  While it's plug 'n play, I decided to forgo the install CD and just downloaded the drivers directly from the manufacturer's website.  While the video is decent quality, it still retains some grainyness after burning the video to a DVD, the quality of the original played on a VCR is still better quality than what you capture and burn to a DVD.  That being said, it's not all that bad, really.  But since I only needed to copy a few home videos that we made from an old VHS-C camcorder it wasn't really worth it.I found that the best way to get the best quality was to adjust the video settings manually (add a little more saturation, and sharpness), and use the ""DVD"" format for capture, that were there is minimal second encoding required when you burn to a disc (I use windows DVD maker, because I'm cheap :B)The nice thing is it also includes an S-video option, unfortunately my VCR only allows S-video with 480p signals (ie DVD movies and restricts VCR video to 480i.  The DVD capture format seems to add some deinterlacing to the captured video from what I can tell (though it might just be my video card doing it)  Still, it's a pretty good buy for someone who wants to archive or even send family members burned DVDs of videos.,

17,"If anyone have used previous version of nook you will immediately see the improvements on new version of nook. One of the most important feature I found on the new nook was better page turn response. The screen refresh when moving from page to page is much quicker, nearly matching the refresh rates of the latest Kindle. The Nook also added a laundry list of interface and usability improvements, such as the ability to organize your book collection by category which is called ""shelves"".I liked 600 X 800 display screen. It comes with 16 shades of gray and is easy to your eyes. I can read all day without hurting my eyes. My personal opinion, i would love this device more if I could read it at night without lights.ProsLibrary with thousands of books, magazine that comes free, built-in free wireless data network, plus Wi-Fi connectivity (no PC needed); separate capacitive color touch-screen pad for navigation, and a virtual keyboard for notes and annotations; 2GB of internal memory (capable of storing 1,500 electronic books) as well as a microSD expansion slot for additional memory; font style and size are adjustable; displays image files and plays MP3 music files; compatible with Windows and Mac machines; battery is removable and user-replaceable; allows free browsing of full-text books while within Barnes & Noble stores; you can lend certain e-books for up to 14 days free of charge; EPUB format compatibility lets you read free Google Books and loaner e-books from your local library; page turn speeds are faster with firmware upgrade.The bad: No protective carrying case included; color LCD ( for color nook)  has an impact on battery life; for black & white battery is really good,in-store reading and loaning capabilities come with notable limits and caveats; no support for Word or text files; no ability to download books when outside the U.S., even when on Wi-Fi.Does it beat Kindle?According to design my answer is no.  The third-generation Amazon Kindle is lighter, thinner, and simply feels a little better to hold in your hand. It also offers double the battery life, more internal memory (4GB versus 2GB). But the new upgrades has given some new features to nook that are not available in kindle. Nook should definitely remain under consideration when you're shopping for e-ink e-book readers. The decision may come down to a personal preference, such as how you feel about the color navigation screen versus the hard keyboard found on the Kindle.If my review did not answer any questions, leave a comment below and I will try my best to answer your question.,
","RJ45 cables are so common these days, you'd think everything would be worked out by now... apparently not so.The worst thing you can do to any electronic cable is kink it, bend it sharply, put a crimp in it. But my 7 footers, shown on Amazon in an appropriately nicely formed loop, all arrived in a tight wad with sharp bends every 3 1/2 to 4 1/5 inches along the entire length, and then tightly bound in the middle with a wire tie. Each kink even created a discolored joint on the cable jacket. Cables don't like sharp bends (mine have 17 tight bends along a 7' cable), those kinks make cables hard to string and route along small spaces, they make a rat's nest behind my comm gear, and they jeopardize the integrity of the cable.C'mon Belkin, your ""Pro Series"" packaging is a silly gimmick, because at a thrifty $2.50 per cable, I'm betting dollars to donuts there's nothing special about your cables, no rare metals, no exotic coatings, no braided stainless shielding... it's a generic Ethernet cable. Nothing more, nothing less. Kindly treat it as such. Treat them kindly and fore go the glitzy packaging.Meanwhile, my 15' cables from Mediabridge happily arrived in a simple cardboard box, in a neat 5"" diameter coil. No kinks, no sharp bends. I try to order from Mediabridge when possible because they seem to know how to package and deliver cables that work out of the box, no fancy packaging, no rocket science, no need to hang a cable for a week to work out the kinks, just a sound cable. Unfortunately, they did not have 7-footers when I needed them. So I went with Belkin, after all it's just a cable. Next time I'll wait for Mediabridge to re-stock.,
","Obviously these headphones are not for the audiophile. Nor are they for the person who expects anything they buy to last for a decade or more.These headphones are for the person who wants tolerably decent sound reproduction in a compact package. Commuters, some travelers and others with modest expectations will love these. They fold into a pretty small package that can be tucked into a somewhat large package or a fanny pack or backback or mesenger bag or what have you. The headband has a wide range of adjustment and maintains the position you set it in.The earphones are large enough to cover most ears and are comfortable for extended wear. (I've been wearing them while sitting at the computer for the laat five hours without any discomfort.)If you don't demand much in the way of bass or treble, the audio range is acceptable. As I said, these headphones are not intended for audiophiles. That said, distortion isn't a problem even with the audio cranked up.These headphones don't pretend to be noise-cancelling. They are just nice average headphones with adequate audio response and the added benefit of folding into a manageably small form factor. They are sturdy within a limited degree and should last for several months. Considering their price, the need to replace them from time to time is hardly a pain.Overall, a good value as long as you don't demand or expect more than the product can deliver.Jerry,

18,"I was the biggest nook/kindle hater on the planet before being gifted this nook. I would constantly diss the e-readers claiming that books were soooo much better. Then I ordered a book series from Amazon and the books/print was so tiny that I could barely read them without straining my eyes and driving myself crazy. My mom (&lt;3!!) gave me my brothers old nook since he had a new nook color so I could download and read the series on this. It wasn't cheap to download the books, but compared to reading the free versions a friend had sent me (which were horrible because the text was all messed up...typos galore) but the option to make the text larger or smaller and the clarity of the screen made the 8+ dollars per book soooo worth the price.The battery on this lasts so long it's insane. I would read daily maybe 5 hours per day over the summer (hey, I had to finish the series before school resumed!) and I only had to charge it once a week tops, even then the battery wasn't drained I just didn't want to give it a chance to run out. I am so in love with my nook now it's insane. I can download almost any book I could possibly need and carry it around in this tiny little, lightweight nook.Another big plus....MY BOOKMARKS DON'T FALL OUT OF THE NOOK!! Nothing is more frustrating than losing your place and going bananas trying to find it without revealing something you haven't read yet.Also, when it comes to textbooks this is a lifesaver!! My back loves the nook. I cannot recommend the nook (or any e-reader in general) enough. You can still buy physical books (I do and will never stop because I absolutely love them) but for an avid reader the nook is such a great addition to your life.Even though my first nook was free (making it that much sweeter), I would gladly lay down $100+ for a replacement if anything happened to mine or for a newer model, not the color though, that's more like a tablet PC than an e-reader.,
","The Zip100 is a minimum necessity for today's larger and larger file formats - MPEG, MP3, and multiple images files can easily run up to 100MB.  I've used the Zip since its inception when it knocked old Syquest 88MB  drives out of business about 5 years ago.  The size and convenience is why  there is really only one choice for removable media with easy and immediate  read-write capability.There are definite pluses and minuses.  Some will  say get a CD-R(W) drive - but burning a CD is definitely not as immediate  as a Zip. The parallel port is a major bummer because of the thru-speed.  But those of you who are not major speed demons won't be disappointed  compared to a floppy.  The Zip drive allows daisy chaining so you can  connect/output to other peripherals.Iomega cut cost on the power  on/off (it's always on when plugged in).  But really the overall design is  very good - you can place it flat or vertical.  Even though the thick  parallel cord may tend to twist the main unit.There are a plethora of  other Iomega choices.  And I would really ask yourself if you are planning  on USB or SCSI - each are noticeably faster.  On the plus side, the 100MB  format is so common in print shops, university labs, and copy places that  you can't go wrong.  Plus the price of each disk is recognizably less than  the 250MB.  Seriously think about your file formats.  If you plan to do a  lot video - you'll need to go with a Jaz.  And you can get these  refurbished for about the same cost and hold 1Gig.  The only barrier to  entry is the SCSI necessity and the extra cost of disks.  Overall, the  Zip100 has been a major workhorse for me - back and forth between work and  home/Mac and PC MS98/NT.  It has performed flawlessly.,
","I've been using these for over a year now.  Basically, in a quiet environment these sound pretty good.  They aren't as good as similarly-priced studio-class headsets, but you're paying for the noise cancelling.  The raw capability is pretty decent, and has acceptable detail in treble, vocal, and bass ranges.The noise cancelling works pretty well.  I've taken these on several intercontinental flights and they do a decent job of blocking out engine rumble and screaming kids.  They also do a decent job of blocking out adult human voices, which is nice in the office.However, I must have pretty big ears, and I've found that the foam cups aren't quite thick enough to adequately push the driver away from my outer ear.  After 2 or 3 hours of use my ears start to ache a bit.The cord is plenty long, and can be disconnected in the middle to link to an optional Sony wired remote control.  An adapter to convert the standard 1/8th inch stereo jack to the dual 1/8th inch jacks in many airplane seats is included.The thing that I don't like about this is that I find these uncomfortable when I try to lean my head against the window in an airplane and sleep.  I think that the MDR-NC11's might have been a better choice in that regard.They're also kind of bulky unless you have a large carry-on to keep them in.  I'm paranoid about putting these in the seat pocket in front of me, since the MDR-NC20's come with a soft bag instead of a rigid clamshell like the Bose headsets.  I haven't had any spills yet, but active travellers may wish to find a case that's more rigid.All in all, I'm pretty happy with these.  The natural audio sound and the noise cancelling are plenty sufficient for the price... I couldn't justify the $300 for Bose unless I needed the protective clamshell and had ears that fit perfectly into their earcups.,
"
19,"I asked for this e-reader for Christmas due to seeing it in a Barnes and Noble store and learning about its features. It  offers greater compatibility with different ebook formats than the Kindle (particularly the EPUB format), has access to special offers when you're inside a Barnes and Noble store, and permits you to lend books to other Nook users. There's also a little color LCD touch screen at the bottom for accessing menu options.Personally, I haven't taken advantage of most of the Nook's features yet, but I do like what I see so far. The touchscreen adds a great deal of versatility to the device and I'd say it's easier to access menu options this way than with just one e-ink screen and some buttons. I also appreciate the ability to upgrade the memory with a microSD card, but I would have preferred to do so without opening the device. Also, if you have a problem with the Nook, you shouldn't have a problem getting a replacement. I, er, damaged my first Nook through, shall we say, ""user error,"" but B&N; staff was happy to provide a new one for me.It's not quite perfect, though. It's kind of heavy, for one thing. The touchscreen is a bit slow to respond and can significantly drain the battery, for another. And, some of the Nook's buttons seem to be a little too stiff. I prefer soft, clicky buttons, you know? Maybe in its next iteration the Nook will have proper buttons instead of this ""bendy plastic"" business.Anyway, which e-reader you get largely boils down to your personal preferences, and which retailer's online library you'd rather have access to. For my part, I think the Nook satisfies all of my needs just fine. Be careful where you buy it from, though. $180, which is the price it's selling for on Amazon right now, is way too much when you can just walk into a brick and mortar store and get it for thirty bucks less.,
","This is the perfect example of excellent marketing pushing an inferior product to market.  The consumer is fooled into thinking that this &quot;hard case&quot; is actually hard and is actually made of alumunim,  when in fact the case is made of PLASTIC and has two VERY thin strips of  aluminum outside the plastic.  This case could easily crack under little  pressure.  I purchased this case but was greatly disappointed by the  plastic composition and flimsiness of the case.  For 40 bucks you think  you'd get something nice and strong, but save your hard-earned money for  some other case.  If you want just something to protect your Palm V in, I'd  strongly suggest something with a leather cover that is far more durable  than this plastic case.  Even better, go for the leather case that has a  zipper.  For even more protection, go for the Rhinoskin Palm protectors.  Those are a little bit more expensive but are definitely worth the money,  considering the amount of money it costs to replace your Palm if you damage  it.The only reason why you should buy this flimsy, overpriced  &quot;hard case&quot; is if you have a LOT of money to blow, care more  about looks than functionality, and don't care if your Palm actually gets  damaged.  This case will pop open when you don't expect it, and who knows  what will happen to your Palm's panel.,
","I purchased this item, then in afterthought read the reviews listed here.  So I was prepared for some rickety thing that had parts ready to fall off when you touched it, and a viewfinder that was as accurate as throwing a baseball at the tuner knob.  But the promise of awesome reception was all I needed to hear.First off, I work in a building which has a lot of electrical interference.  I needed something to get past that.  That was my only concern.  So it didn't much matter, as long as I could get past the interference.  Now that you know that, let me tell you about this thing.First of all it's not HUGE.  I'm 40 right now, so I've seen rickety bulky radio's that would kill if it hit you.  This is a nice unit, well sized for the speakers and antenna's in it.Second, it's very well built.  I tried to pull off the tuner knob to no effect.  Even the volume, treble and Bass buttons nicely placed on the unit can't be removed without some extra tool.  The switches are only two function switches, and are well built.  Granted it doesn't light up, and the tuner bar isn't a lit bar, but who cares, it's very well built.  I tried to squeeze the unit to see if I could make it crack, no, it's sturdy.Now, for the TUNING ability.  There is a WIDE and NARROW switch, which can either give you a very narrow tuning area, or a much WIDER tuning area.  A station I listen to at 740am appears on the WIDE area from 700 to about 750 on the dial.  However on the NARROW switch, it only comes in within a few millimeters of where 740 is.  That explains why people say the tuning was so bad, they had it set to wide.So all things said and done, how did it do against the interference?  Now basically I'm stuck in an area which is nothing short of several high tower power poles.  The improvement was marginal.  BUT to my surprise there are additional AM/FM jacks on the back that you can add an additional antenna or signal amplifiers to &lt;G>  I grabbed a power cord, wrapped it around the AM port, and between the improvement in tuning, signal grabbing, and the extra antennae, I'm getting very decent reception with only a small bit of hissing.This is a very nice radio, well worth every penny I spent on it.  Hope this review helps.Ed Williams, Colorado Springs, CO,
"
20,"When I purchased this item it was still running $150.  At the current price, I think it's a good deal but I'm not sure it would be my choice if I could roll back time.  I originally purchased this because I wanted to rent ebooks from the Library and that wasn't an option with the Kindle.  Now, they come for the Kindle as well as in epub and pdf formats.  You can basically use any ereader to rent these now.I read all these reviews saying that the black and white was like paper, easiest to read.  It's not anything like a paper book, it's far less ""bright"" when it comes to reading.  Don't get me wrong, I love ebooks.  I haven't read a paper book in a year.  It is just that even in regular light it is not as easy to see for me.  You absolutely can read it without a light during the day, but it is not nearly as crisp or easy as it would be with a paper book.  I have a clip on light, and with that it's perfect at night.  I'm able to read in bed and not disturb my husband, if one wants a black and white reader as close to paper as you can get--I'm just not sure this is what one would expect.This reader has a browser which you can use to get on the internet.  It was handy when we were in a hotel with wifi and I didn't bring the laptop and I needed to know when a business opened.  It's certainly not easy to surf, this would not be my choice to use unless in a pinch.The battery does not last as long as I expected.  I get maybe a week and a half out of it, if I turn it completely off when not using it--and if I have it on airplane mode (not wifi enabled).  I do read at least a few hours a day.  The time is much shorter if I let it just hibernate.I am not sure if the text size options are specific to the device or the book.  It appears to me it is the device that offers limited options, though it varies based on the originating text of the book. The text size on extra large--the largest option-- is often (it varies by book) small enough that it would equal that of a normal book.  My vision is pretty good and occasionally I'm annoyed by how small extra large is.  In some books medium is the same as extra large in others.  I do think that for anyone with vision challenges, limited text size might be an issue.Obtaining books is easy to do through Barnes and Noble.  You need to go online on a computer and provide a credit card.  You can then order them on the computer, or through your device.  I generally use the computer, but if you know what you want--ordering directly from the Nook is quick and easy.  Transferring library rentals is also as easy as drag and drop, using Adobe Digital Solutions (free app, the library should have a link to download it).All in all, it's a good ereader.  I've never had any mechanical issues with it.  It is sturdy and reliable.,
","Well since most reviews have gone into the specifics of this device, I won't delve too deeply into those aspects. However, very rarely did I see any mention of how cheap of a device this is; the plastic feels of very low grade, the reset button litterally rattles it's so loose. Overall, yes the device works, so I won't knock it for that; unfortunately I have no means of testing the actual surge-protection, but I just have to hope that they used better quality electronic components then they used for the case build.Pros of the device:-----------------------+Smart circle design; obviously the main advantage of this is taht you are no longer limited by annoying power bricks taking up/blocking outlets. For that it works great.+Cute design; it looks slightly better than a normal surge protector with its circle form factor and brightly color coded outlets; however, the design is slightly hindered by how cheap the materials are, and looks less cute in person.+Long cord; 16ft is pretty long, so make sure you need that long of a cord, since the average cord length is around 6-8ft for a surge protector. Still for my application, a long cord is a plus (since I needed at least a 12ft cord).Cons:----------Really bad build quality; again, just super cheap plastic, and the reset button is really wobbly, barely feels like it's held on. The cord seems of decent gauge/insulation at least, and the device has some heft so it may just be cheap on the exterior.-No swivel outlet; for the cost of this device, it really should come with a swivel outlet connection, so if your outlet is upside-down (connected to a light switch) or you need it to go to the right of the socket, the cord will be tweaked in the wrong direction. I have no problems with cheap protectors not having a rotating outlet, but on something that costs almost $40 it really should have included it.Summary:-------Look, if we're rating the device on whether it provides power or not, of course it works, and should get 5 stars. The circle design is also very nice, and again worthy of some stars. But with how poor the build quality is on this (and this was ordered from Amazon directly, not 3rd party), and the fact that they didn't even throw in nicer features like a swivel socket for how pricey this retails for, I can't give this a fantastic rating (but will still give it an OK rating as it does in fact work, but that alone doesn't deserve 5 stars). I purchased the device on a Cyber-Monday sale, and even at the significantly-reducted price I'm still debating on if I should keep it or not. I have several surge protectors from all sorts of brands, and as such I'm somewhat disappointed with what should have been a nicer protector feeling and looking so cheap. I'd say for a sale price it might be worth it, or if you're really looking for a longer cord surge protector it might be worth it (although I have several longer-cord protectors that didn't cost near this much), but I've purchased much better protectors at even better prices when they go on sale.,
","If you love AM radio and are looking for a radio that has fantastic reception your choice comes down to two radios: the ccradio plus and the GE Superadio. These are the best radios on the market for fans of talk, sports, Art Bell, Phil Hendrie, etc. Which one should you buy? I have both (the GE for my office, ccradio for home) so here is my take on the two. Both have nearly equal AM reception. At night, you can easily pull in stations from hundreds of miles away (some say even over a thousand miles away but this depends on where you live). There the difference ends. The ccradio has a lot of features that I felt I wanted in a radio. It has a sleep timer, accurate digital tuning, automatic timer that turns your favorite show on at a predetermined time, scan buttons, lighted dial, power cord (not bulky adaptor), weather radio (with auto alert), memory buttons, tv audio of the network stations. The only flaw is that it has a grab indentation rather than a full handle. They are a family business and take GOOD care of their customers. The ccradio company LOVES radio and loves people who share their passion. Is it worth the [$$] for the extras? To me it is. The Ge Superadio has a rotary - and inaccurate - tuning dial. This will drive you crazy if you do a lot of channel switching. Some people tape graph paper to the radio and mark where they found the stations - it is that inaccurate. There is no timer, no alarm, no weather, no tv audio, no lit dial, etc. The sound is better on the GE Superadio, though. The GE SUperadio feels cheaply made and probably won't make it through many beach or camping excursions. The GE Superadio is enormously sized - it is the size of a small attache case or TV! If you only want to pull in one distant station and keep your dial set to that station, get the GE radio. That is all you need. It has great, almost legendary, reception without any bells or whistles. On the other hand, if you love radio, need the extras, change stations a lot, want something sturdily built that will last a lifetime, want to explore the large number of AM stations that are out there, go out and order the ccradio with slightly better reception (see their website to order). I am a radio person rather than a tv person. I have radio playing all day (as some people have tv going on all day). I sleep to radio (and need that sleep timer). I would rather listen to a talk show than watch a sit com. I would rather listen to Coast to coast, Phil Hendrie, and Rush than watch another rerun of Frasier or Friends. If you are like me, do yourself a favor and invest in the ccradio. You won't regret it. P.S., the FM reception will be better than you are used to, also.Bottom line: The GE superadio is low cost with no extras and big and bulky. The CCradio plus is expensive, has every extra you could want (except a decent handle), more sensitive but does nto sound as good as the GE for music.,

21,"I have been eyeballing e-readers for a while and I was absolutely certain that I was going to purchase a Kindle.  Well many moons ago I worked at Barnes and Noble and stopped in to visit and old friend.  He introduced me to the Nook, I shrugged up my nose and said, 'Yeah, I'm sold on the Kindle.'After playing around with the Nook, I really found myself enamored of it.  I like the touch screen.  I like that the battery replacement if necessary is something the consumer can do.  I liked that you could share your nook books with others.  On the Nook that I have -and I did purchase a refurbished Nook - games included are suduko and chess.  The daily is a feature that automatically downloads articles specifically for the Nook users.  The library is where you can store all of your books and create shelves for your titles and organize the titles.  Shopping is a breeze, either directly on the nook or online.  You will need a card, be it debit or credit to purchase the books, you can use gift cards, but I believe that you need to have a card on file.I can store and listen to music on my Nook, I can access the internet (mine is WiFi) and use it to search and answer email or update facebook.In short, I'm madly in love with it.  I have not had any problems with it.  The charge holds for a pretty long time, I haven't measured it in time myslef.It is simple to use, very friendly and there is an incredible book selection for the Nook.  i happen to be a big fan of classic literature and Russian literature and I have had no trouble filling up my library.  Storage capacity is quite large and i have an additional micro SD card just in case, but I am no where near filling up my storage yet.The books are also available on my personal computer, and if I decide to archive a book, but do not necessarily want to delete the title altogether, I can archive it and later retrieve that title from my online account.  Archiving titles would allow you to free up space on your Nook.Recommendations, I have a silicone slip cover to protect my Nook if I drop it, I also have a slightly hardcover case to protect the Nook when it is in my purse, I do have a book light as the screens are not backlit to avoid glare.The only downside, some fools will think your screen is paper and they will touch it in awe and smudge up your reading screen.,
","I owned a Palm III for a while when it came out, and then stepped up to the V after about a year with my III. What can I say? I was allured by its sexiness and general asthetic appeal.I have now relied on it for about a  year for all my organizing needs. I have used every part of the Palm  Software suite except the expense reporting feature.While I like the  Palm V's style, I have become more and more disappointed by its features  and memory issues.Features: lacks decent sound for starters, a beep is  boring and weak. When I carry the Palm in its home (my pocket) I cannot  hear the alarm tones even with volume maxed! The screen is a mixed bag.  While its clarity is better than other organizers, it is very hard to read  in slightly dim areas because the backlighting leaves a lot to be desired.  Battery power is okay, but not anywhere near the advertised time of 30  days.Memory is a whole different issue. All I have on my palm is some  1500 addresses and 1000 calendar entries and it tells me I am half full, as  you know they advertise a lot more capacity. I don' use but a couple of  aftermarket programs.The Graffiti recognizer is crap. When it works it  puts the wrong letters on the screen. Real users need to get Jot! from  CiC.Palm, Inc.'s tech support is the WORST! Most of their support staff  can hardly speak English; so imagine them trying to explain a highly  technical issue! Whats more, they don't even care. I was pormised a return  call - had to call back. I have not once ever received a real response by  email - only autoresponders that say &quot;24-48 hours&quot; - still  waiting on my inquiry from January!In short, save a little longer and  get the Cassiopeia E-115 (when it comes out). In my experiences with  head-to-head comparrisons of Cassiopeia E-105s to my Palm V, the Cassio was  a true frontrunner! The E-115 will certainly be even better! If you need a  great datebook and address book to keep you straight and don't need sound,  memory, genuine Word Processing, or Spreadsheet, or color screen then GO  WITH THE PALM V!  But if you need features and real performance, get a  Windows CE Device.,
","I have spent the last 2 weeks trying to get decent FM radio reception in the middle of an office building with significant EMI (Electromagnetic Interference).  I tried three radios, including the Radio Shack (RS) Portable AM/FM Radio with Extended AM Range, Cat# 12-903, which is modeled after the GE Superadio.  (The Superadio and the RS 12-603/12-903 are often compared out on various pages on the internet and have the exact same features.)  My goal was to receive my favorite FM station, which is a weaker station sandwiched between two strong stations.  The Superadio, with the help of a C. Crane FM Reflect antenna found at ..was the only radio/antenna combo that would bring it in for me. (I also tried 3 other antennas, including 2 amplified antennas)  Another nice item is that I get excellent FM reception on almost every channel now.  The ability to turn off the Auto Frequency Control seems to make all the difference for my needs.  The RS 12-903 had the same switch, but I didn't notice a significant difference when I turned it on or off, like I do with the Superadio.  The only thing the RS 12-903 had going for it was it's sturdier case, but it was  more, even on sale.  I haven't done much with AM, so I can't comment on that.  I hope this is helpful.,

22,"First let me say that when the Nook first came out on the market it caught my eye. I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.Then the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.Right out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...Now with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.Now with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews. Well back to my Nook, as I can not put it down!What a great gift, and a great buy!!!**************Update****************5/30/2011The Nook is still awesome... Since I have owned the Nook for a while now, I came back to offer an update..As far as downloading books, I downloaded books the other day and before I could blink they were on my Nook!I am still happy with my Nook and love my Nook! I have recommended the Nook to friends and family who have also made purchases and are happy with the Nook as well.The performance of my Nook is awesome, and I have had great experiences with my Nook since the day I was surprised with the Nook as a gift! Best gift anyone can give! The joy of reading!I take my Nook with me every where! My children are still in love with my Nook and love to play the games on my Nook or read a book. My husband even likes for the children to read books on the Nook. The Nook has brought so much fun and the joy of reading to our family!You can also go to Barnes and Nobles and take classes to learn more about your Nook as there is so much to learn and so much that the Nook has to offer. Check in your area to see what times your local Barnes and Nobles offers classes.I also like the Nook because the Nook continues to educate you on a daily basis with the daily blog of what took place on the days of the week, for example if you turn on your Nook right now and go to the daily, it will inform you what took place on this date. Which to me is a neat feature as you get to learn something new about something you may have  not known.As far as the touch screen part of the Nook, we love it! It does not distract us but adds to the beauty of the Nook in our opinion. It is easy for my family to use.********2012 Update*****Well it is 4/24/2012 and I still love my Nook and my Nook still works great! I just wanted to give another update for individuals looking for a e reader.As of this date, our children are now asking as they did before can they have my Nook. And for now they can use my Nook, but I still love Nook and I am not ready to give my Nook up. One day we will purchase Nooks for the whole family.As far as use, I was out in the sun and reading with no problem. So many e reads and tablets are currently on the market. This nook still works for me and still performs and amazes me. There is still so much to learn with the Nook I currently own. If you are looking for a great affordable e reader. Don't over look Nook.  Good luck with your decision.Hopefully this update will help you in your decision. We would by one hundred more and pass them out as gifts and charity, just so people can get to read and find joy in reading! Great tool to use to educate children and adults!Back to my Nook!,
","I've played with this digital camcorder for about 5 days now and I am delighted with it's quality and features. If anyone's disappointed with the quality of the video (see reviews below), they are probably being  unrealistic in their expectations. To get better video, you'd have to go up  to a 3CCD camera (at about 3times the cost!). As for those who say that the  camera is too big and heavy, I say just TRY shooting a still video without  a tripod with a camera as small as a paperback book! You NEED something  larger to get a good steady picture (even with &quot;steadyshot&quot;). I  appreciate Sony's innovative digital 8 because the tapes are less  expensive, but you still have the quality of digital recording (the Pauses  are terrific!). I'm not worried that these tapes are not interchangeable  with the mini-DV format. I mean, how often would I want to trade digital  tapes with someone? I also have the option of playing back any old 8 or  hi-8 videotapes that were previously recorded, and converting them to  digital (try THAT with a mini-DV camcorder)! I like having A/V outputs AND  inputs so that I can digitally record from a source other than the camera  lens. The Sony infrared &quot;nightshot&quot; is astounding. It's like have  nightvision goggles for your camcorder! The LCD screen on the TRV310 is  WONDERFUL... 3.5 inches! The 20X optical zoom is sufficient, and going  partway into the digital zoom ain't too bad either (as long as you don't  try to actually use the full 360X!) I cannot say enough good things at this  point. If I have to find something negative to say, I wish some of the  controls were in easier locations to get to while I'm still filming. All in  All, a nifty camcorder that I HIGHLY recommend!,
","Memorex is a brand name that does offer excellent product support, and certainly this product is excellent for two reasons. First, because it's easy to use. Cover art from CD's that have missing artwork can be relatively easily dropped into the blank template software provided at the Memorex website, and you can create cover art that functionally replaces the missing original artwork inside the jewel cases for your CD collection. Where it gets tricky - if darn near impossible - is creating the rear front insert printing. But if you're looking to put a cover and a tray insert in quick and fast this is the product.The instructions for creating cover art that looks decent or retail-presentable is very spare if not available at all. Part of the reason for this is that 99% of all retail CD cover art and jewel case inserts are printed on glossy paper and not the type of paper that ships with this product. The Maxell product, however, is on matte paper. This requires attention to detail when selecting inkjet printer settings, as you want to use the amount of ink that is usually dispersed for, say, a matte greeting card. If you use the incorrect setting, you can often spoil the insert by using entirely too much ink and creating a ""wavy"" effect in the art that will doom your intentionally perfect effort to the waste bin. So do a few test runs before you make a final copy - or at least expect you'll use 4-5 to get used to the product if it's the first time you're making cover art.The format of the pre-printed and pre-perforated sheet is excellent, however. But there are some bits of advice worth considering when removing the cover art. As the manufacturer indicates, you will want to fold along the seams that need to be torn in order to get a somewhat clean cut from the 8.5"" x 11"" sheet. You won't get the seamless cut you get, say, from Avery business card stock of the premium variety, but you'll get an acceptably clean cut if you follow this rule.Also be careful not to tear the perforations on the rear art that are meant to be where the folds are. I did this on the first sheet and had to repeat!The software enables you to line up the different edges of the original cover art to the template itself - but as with anything on a printer, make sure your printer is lined up correctly with the paper so you don't have any overlap. My advice is to slightly oversize the original art (easy to do if you have a basic understanding of image editing software) so that you can be sure you have a complete piece of art without white edges on top, bottom, or either side. It takes some tweaking - it's not as simple as just dragging, dropping, and printing.All that said, this product is more than adequate - software and inserts - for making gift mix CD's. The intuitive software guides you through the processes of creating cover art with either custom or stock image backgrounds, and placing track lists on your inserts. In fact the software is so useful, I am considering the use of the software with my own sheets sourced from another paper supplier, and then cutting the art myself from standard sheet stock.In short this product is adequate for replacement of cover art of value-priced CD's to be sold at retail, or to give a faceless CD a new jewel case home for your personal collection. But if you're looking for perfection in recreating major record label quality cover art, then look elsewhere. Alternatively if you are making your own CD's to be jewel cased as gifts or to create DVD ROM cover art for custom projects - business or personal - this would be an excellent product. For example creating a professional portfolio or storage cases for personal media would be two excellent uses for this product. Since I have almost one hundred of these sheets, I'll work my way through them. But because I have customers who demand near-retail-new perfection in their purchases, I am going to have to begin a thorough search for a product that maintains more of that specific aesthetic.On value and price this is an excellent product - certainly much cheaper than the retail locations where I had seen them locally. And again if you're using these for personal data storage, home-made products, or whatnot, these are excellent. That said they provide an exacting and demanding customer an ersatz product, that, if printed on a low DPI printer, can appear even - dare I say - kitschy.But with Amazon Prime offers and excellent delivery, I'm not throwing stones at retailers - just letting consumers know that if you're looking for what I was looking for - replacement cover art with the aesthetic of that of the major record labels, you'll need to do a little more digging out on the market for a good fit.,
"
23,"I've had my Nook for about 2 weeks and love it. Before I purchased it, I spent weeks researching the differences between the Barnes and Noble Nook and the Kindle and other ereaders. I chose the Nook because I can read .epub format books on it; something you cannot do on the Kindle. The Kindle only supports .pdf files and ebooks in the proprietary Amazon.com format. That severely limits the number and type of ebooks you can read.With the Nook, I have borrowed free ebooks from my local library and within minutes downloaded them to my computer and then transferred them to my Nook. AWESOME! In addition, unlike the Kindle, I can read free ebooks available from Google.The only thing I don't like about the Nook and the Kindle is that neither one of them has a back-lit screen so, at night or in the dark, you have to have alternative ample light. So I either turn on a lamp or use the small, clip-on light I bought at the local RiteAid for about $10. It works just fine.So far, I have had no problems navigating my ebooks; everything works smoothly and the pages turn quickly. I'm enjoying the convenience of being able to travel with 30 books and audio-books at a time. I also have some music loaded on my Nook so I can listed to it while I read. Lastly, I'm glad I bought a case for it because I pretty much take it every place I go so the hard case prevents the screen from getting scratched or broken.I'm very happy with my purchase.,
","My Grundig 300PE was a Christmas gift, 2009. One week later, it wouldn't turn on.(PLEASE NOTE THIS IS AN UPDATED REVIEW... MY FULL REVISION AND EXPLANATION IS FOUND BELOW, UNDER THE ASTRIX ...)I've installed new batteries and it won't work on the external power source either. The ""light"" works, but nothing else will power up.This is frustrating, and sadly Grundig when it was a product made in Germany, was an outstanding line of radios. Now that they are made in China, there is no reliability in the products.I'd suggest ""buy at your own risk"" and understand that this radio has a short shelf-life.The audio quality (while typical for a radio having a speaker this small) was GOOD. It had an easy time receiving a signal inside my home in a rural area, miles away from FM transmitters. My old Sony portable radio (which I purchased and took to Russia in 1989 in order to get shortwave broadcasts from the USA) finally died after 20 years. The Grundig (when it worked) never performed as well as my Sony (made in Japan)but I wasn't too disappointed with the performance of Shortwave listening on this tiny radio. The Sony would hold a station better and not drift as bad as the Grundig and the Sony had vastly superior audio, despite having a speaker about the same size as the Grundig.******* UPDATE.  This Grundig radio EASILY ""dies"" often after being powered off and left to sit idle for a few days. I thought a component had gone bad inside the radio and I was about to shoot a video to post on YouTube showing a hammer crushing the darned thing because it ""died.""  However, I have been able to get this radio to working again (on several occasions) by pulling the cover off where the batteries go and discovering on my own, that there is a very VERY tiny reset button under the batteries. It has to be reset with a toothpick or a paper clip. When I reset the radio, it's like it comes back from the dead and works. But that being said, resetting this little monster is a frequent chore.,
","I gave it only 3 stars because the focus is just a marketing gimmick that creates a cheap focusing mechanism.  A decent traditional wheel for focusing is superior.  You can't easily get a good focus, pressing your eyes against the eyepiece can force them out of focus, and it's easy to bump the rocker bar.  At 16x power, you have to carefully adjust focus and a rocker bar is an awful design.  You have to use both hands to focus: you can press down on one side of the rocker bar, but not up, so to go in and out of focus to get good sharpness, you have to press down with one hand's finger and then press down with the other hand's finger.  The rocker bar is terrible idea, especially for 16x!  To make matter's worse, there is a fair amount of play in the rocker bar.  The rocker bar seems to be the limiting factor on short distances. 40 feet seemed to be the shortest distance they would focus.  Stars come into focus well before the limit of the long-distance focus is reached, possibly indicating questionable workmanship, or maybe it makes it better for those who are really-bad near-sighted.The moons of jupiter were clear and sharp even under city lights.  Since it was the brightest ""star"" in the sky I thuoght i was looking at venus, but when i saw the 3 sharp dots surrounding the round disk, i knew it had to be jupiter.  You have to rest them on a chair to see the moons.The price here at Amazon (with free shipping) is $20 less than my local Walmart after our 10% taxes.16x requires a fence or car or window to provide the stability needed to make full use of 16x. Even without a prop, it's good, but if your not going to use a prop, 12x50 is better because the amount of light is greater and the field of view is larger.,
"
24,"When I first heard about e-book readers, I was skeptical and did not want to give up my precious collection of books. (I have a teeny tiny little hoarder of books inside of me!) But then I finally caved and decided to try one because of my difficulty in reading larger and heavier books laying in bed at night, and due to being away from home for periods of time where I couldn't easily carry a dozen books with me.The first reader I had experience with was when my grandpa had purchased one of those huge honkin' Kindle DS readers with the full key pad. I was excited about that one, but the price was WAY out of range. I decided to try and go with the Nook (after my typical pre-purchase ritual of spending days doing research on the best option) and I was so thrilled with it, I had nothing bad to say. I used that little beauty for a few good years, until I was forced to sell it to help pay bills. From the very moment the Nook left my hands I regretted it. I was certain I'd never find one that good again. And I don't believe there has been any readers since then that are that good still!Fast-forward to this Black Friday. The FIRST Black Friday when I actually HAVE some money to spend! And I am looking for a really good e-reader! I did come across the Nook on Amazon, and saw the new Nook Simple Touch, which intrigued me, because I wanted to stick with the e-ink display, and not have a full-size touch screen battery killer. Finally, I realized my love for the original Nook had never died, and it still had everything I could ever want in an e-book reader. I was even able to buy one from a vendor here on Amazon, who lived less than half an hour away from me, and it only cost me $50!!! I was SOOOOO excited!!Now, if only I had NOT wasted $5 on that stupid fake-leather black cover, that completely RUINED the casing on my Nook... :(,
","Pros: Excellent value, great picture quality in S-VHS, jog/shuttle, S-Video in/outs, Easy setup, cables included, quality construction, lots of features, OK tracking, Super VHS ET mode, 400+ lines of resolution, Has 19u Heads For Taping In The Extended Mode, Can Record Super VHS On Standard Tapes, do I need to say more?!?!Cons: Tracking problems in EP mode, flimsy, some color problems, Super VHS tapes may be hard to find and expensive, the menu system is kind of complicated, Clunky remote, traditional programming procedure, Front Display PanelThe Bottom LineThe HR3600U is a bargain &#65533; the picture quality, S-VHS ability and features for $ are excellent.Highly Reccommended!!IntroductionMy reason for purchasing this VCR was simple. I wanted an inexpensive VCR with S-Video inputs. For those who may not know, S-Video inputs allow the transfer of 400 lines of resolution, as opposed to the usual 260 or so transmitted via RCA connections. In theory, the higher the resolution is the better the picture looks.FunctionalityIn addition to the VCR, there are a set of RCA cables and an S-Video cable included as well. Overall the unit is a piece of cake to setup. The unit has both RCA and S-Video jacks on the back, and a set of RCA jacks on the front. This makes it easy to hook up an external source (such as a camcorder or something) and record to VHS. I have my unit hooked up to my computer (it has a video card with S-Video out and RCA audio outs), and I haven&#65533;t actually used the input jacks on the front of the VCR. Another feature I really like is the simple 1-touch recording button on the unit. The way I have it set up, I can just reach up from my computer and hit it, and off it goes.This unit has a jog/shuttle wheel which is used to perform all the rewinds and fast forwards. I&#65533;ll have to say, this is my first experience with a shuttle wheel. I like it! It just seems more cool than a &#65533;rewind&#65533; or &#65533;fast forward&#65533; button. Lol The unit rewinds tapes faster than my old Zenith VCR.The clock is easy to set as well. I think this is an area which has been greatly improved upon in recent years. For that matter, all the menu items are laid out in a common sense manner, which makes programming and such even easier.I noticed some were saying they didn&#65533;t like the remote control, but I think it is just fine. Grant it, I don&#65533;t use it much, but the times I have used it, I haven&#65533;t encountered any problems with it.Two other things I really like are (1) Having a time code counter display on the LCD so you know how much you&#65533;ve recorded. (2) When you rewind, this little bar pops up on screen and shows you where you are relative to the length of the tape. It&#65533;s not really super useful, but I just like knowing where I&#65533;m at.Picture QualityI&#65533;ll have to say that for $, this unit produces great quality dubs in regular VHS mode. I&#65533;ve been using it for several months now, and the video productions I&#65533;ve produced always come out looking very good. And that&#65533;s the most important thing! I haven&#65533;t dubbed anything in S-VHS or S-VHS ET mode yet because none of my projects have warranted that. I would imagine that the picture quality would be even more outstanding than the regular VHS mode though.Nit PicksWhile the outer enclosure looks nice, the unit &#65533;feels- cheap. I don&#65533;t think it would hold up too well under any kind of rough conditions. Hopefully this VCR will reside either in your home theater or a setup like mine where it stays put and isn&#65533;t moved around too much.The cheesy &#65533;glow in the dark&#65533; keys on the keypad of the remote. I hate it when electronics manufacturer&#65533;s use these gimmicky things. They never work.ConclusionsFor the money, you just can&#65533;t beat this VCR. The ease of setup and great picture quality are this VCR&#65533;s strongest points. I highly recommend this VCR to anyone looking for a budget level VCR.,
","These are decent binoculars.  They are rubber armored and seem fairly sturdy.  I live on the 9th floor near the beach.  These are great for watching moving boats and jetskis go by through my living room window.  They are good for a quick look at something, but difficult to hold steady for more than 30 seconds.  I guess that's the same for all 16x binoculars.  They work better with a tripod mount and a tripod.  These are probably easier to hold steady than 20x50's.  The Zip focus is handy.  The focus at 16x magnification is more critical than 8x or 10x binoculars.  I find myself re-focusing very frequently.  Kind of a pain after using my other Bushnell 8x25 Permafocus binoculars, which NEVER need to be refocused.  I got these for stargazing.  They don't work as well as expected for that purpose.  First, the BAK7 prisms don't transmit light as well as BAK4 prisms.  Second, the 50mm objective lens is not large enough for 16x magnification at night.  I also own a pair of Pentax Whitetails 10x50's which are much better for stargazing.  The Whitetails are much easier to hold steady and the image is much brighter at night.  The Whitetails are slightly heavier though.  The Celestron 15x70's are probably a better choice for stargazing if you want high magnification.  I thought about returning the Bushnell 16x50's because they aren't so good at night.  I gave them a second chance today and decided to keep them for daytime use.  Not bad as a spare pair to have around with higher magnification than 8x or 10x, but I don't recommend them as your first or only pair of binoculars though.As for magnification, 7x and 8x binos are fairly easy to hold steady.  10x approaches the limit of steadyness for handheld use.  I used to have a pair of Tasco 12x50's and tried to use them for stargazing.  I had to prop my elbows on a car hood to use them.  Even then, they were not very steady.  I loaned them to a friend for a football game once, and I never saw them again.  No great loss really.  16x is really pushing the limit for shakeyness.  There's no way I'd buy 20x binoculars for handheld use.  8x seems to be the best compromise between steadyness and magnification.  For stargazing, many authors recommend 7x50 binoculars.  Personally, I don't think 7x magnification is good enough.  You'll want something with higher magnification after trying them.  You can't really go wrong with a pair of 10x50's for stargazing, like the 'Pentax' Whitetails I mentioned before.  The 10x50's might even be cheaper for the same optical quality as 7x50's.  A pair of 8x56's or 9x63's would be good for stargazing too, but the 10x50's are more bang for the buck.  If you've never owned a pair of binoculars before, and you want some good ones for daytime use, you can't really go wrong with a good pair of 8x40's.  I like the 8x40's better than 7x35's, because 7x is not high enough magnification.  The price difference between 7x35 and 8x40 isn't that much.,

25,"High Points:-Easy to read screen-Touchscreen responsive-Love the physical page turning keys on either side (wish the NookColor had this feature)-Size (can hold it easily in one hand)-Lots of Free Classic Books and Classic Books available for 99 cents-Easily transfer books from your library from device to device (any Nook device or device with a Nook App)-Very organized library (and easy to pick up where you left off no matter how long the Nook has been turned off)-Beautiful design & feels very sturdy and well made-Great accessories-Battery Life (charge lasts about 10 days if you have it on with the internet off for a few hours everyday-MUCH better than the NookColor which gets about 3 days with comparable usage)-eLend compatible with your local library if they offer that feature (which is the only reason I chose this over the Kindle)-Free Updates (as the software improves, you won't have to buy a new device to get the upgrades, like faster page turning, better internet experience, etc)-Free eBook Fridays via the Barnes & Noble storeLower Points:-Delay between turning the page (not a deal breaker by any means but there is a flash everytime you turn the page, which I personally don't like)-Weight (you get used to it, but it could be lighter)-Browsing the internet and playing games via the tiny touchscreen is cumbersome. Not to mention the internet function is quite basic and everything is of course in einkConclusion:If you don't have to have a color screen or a touchscreen and just want an eReader, I think this is a great choice. I love some of the features on this and think they should have been on the NookColor. I definitely read a lot more books now and it's easy to take with me everywhere I go.,
","Great camera once you learn the menus and buttons. Advanced users of electronic cameras will find this easy. I have avoided the auto-everything camera's because I like controlling all of the creative process. Because of  this, it took me a while to get used to the menus and buttons, but it was  not hard. The Coolpix 950 still allows you to control the creative process  but I would recommend a good book on digital photography (such as Real  World Digital Photography) to get you started, especially if you're a film  junkie such as myself. Note: a memory card reader for your computer and  bigger CompactFlash cards will make the camera much more enjoyable as well  as rechargeable Ni-MH batteries. The first two replace your film and  processing budget. One nice thing is that you can instantly reuse the  memory card. Mistakes can be erased immediately and the same memory space  used for a better shot. A light steady tripod is also recommended as the  camera has a &quot;speed rating&quot; of ISO 80 and shutter speeds tend to  be slow without flash. If you must use flash, get an external unit as the  on board flash is too close to the lens and, as with all small cameras,  produces flat featureless images. You'll also need access to a good, fast  color printer to print out the full reference manual. A copy center such as  Kinko's should work. This is not a camera for the &quot;instamatic&quot;  crowd. Hint: negative reviewers tend to be disappointed because it is not  an out-of-the-box instant hit, but with a little creative work, the camera  does well. I may trade up to the CoolPix 990 in a year or two after the  price comes down.,
","I was expecting the G2000A to be much better made than it appears to be.  The case is plastic, and not particularly good plastic at that.  The seams between the front and back halves of the case don't fit together well, leaving an unpleasant sharp edge.  The leather cover is nice, and, unlike the plastic case, gives the radio the feel of an item that apparently once sold for $180, or there abouts.I bought the radio thinking it would be an excellent travel alarm/radio.  However, in reality it's much larger and heavier than I expected.The above criticisms all pale into insignificance compared to the reception and sound quality.  Both are extremely poor.  This radio can only lock onto the strongest of stations, and even then there is a fair amount of accompanying 'hiss'.  I don't live in an area with great radio reception; however, my Boston Acoustics Receptor radio has no problem tuning into most stations.  If the Grundig scans the fm band it only finds a grand total of 3 stations.  Short wave is basically worthless on this radio (as is the AM band).For $40 this radio is not a particularly good buy.  There are much better radios for the same price, or significantly less.  The leather cover adds a bit of uniqueness.  In its absence, this radio would be worth $20, at the very most.Bottom line - This radio looks really nice in photos, but dissapoints in reality (both in terms of fit and finish, and tuner quality).,

26,"I bought this device not expecting much out of it.  Reading books is a breeze...the screen is clear even in bright light.  The device is VERY light...feels like holding a small clipboard. I find myself touching the reading part of the screen....just a bad habit as I am used to using my iphone.  As with any device, you might want to breeze thru the manual first because I sure didn't...took me a while to figure out that the ""n"" on the front is the ""home"" key.The craftsmanship feels pretty low end.  I think if for some reason it fell out my hand, it would definitely break.  i have never dropped it...that's just my opinion.  Battery life is good...tho using the wifi decreases the battery life a lot faster.  Though this can browse the net, don't even think about having a good experience doing that...the browser sucks.  Keep in mind, this is not a computer, nor a pocket PC/tablet PC...so if you're looking for something to browse the net, you should buy something else.On a whole, I find the device to be a little slow, but great for what it is intended for. it probably ""turns"" the pages as fast as you would turn the page of a real book.  I'm already used to fast devices, so that is probably why this seems slow to me.**International Buyers**This device will download books if you're outside the US, however, you need to have a credit card that was issued from the US to purchase the books.  I even tried purchasing an eGift card from Barnes and Nobles and using that to purchase my books, and even though i was successful in purchasing the gift card, it will check your default credit card prior to deducting credit from your gift card.  I ended up having to change the name on the account to my mom's name and used her credit card to purchase books. (she lives in the US),
","As a self-employed graphic artist, I bring my laptop with me even on vacations for the sake of work emergencies. It's a 17&#34; MacBook Pro, so it's not small enough for a hotel safe, and I hate leaving it out when I leave the room because I just don't want to tempt housekeeping in that way. Packing it back up to keep it hidden every time I go out has gotten too tiresome, though, so I finally looked around and purchased this security cable.I'm so glad I did.This was a fine fit for my laptop model &#8212;the slot for it is on the right. I wrapped the other end around a closed chair leg, so that if anyone decided to take the laptop, they'd have to take the chair with them too and call attention to themselves. I'm aware that anyone really determined to take it still could, but my laptop being a fairly old model and the security cable being in place, it's really not worth it to the casual snatcher, and that's enough for my peace of mind; it allows me to leave the laptop out on the table, ready for me to log in and get right back to work without having to unpack again and boot up.,
","The good stuff:-BFO for SSB-will tune in 1 KHz steps-very very good sound through phones( if you have good ones)-very good sound with built in speaker-FM stereo through phones-very good FM-good AM/MW-good SW with whip ant.-handy reel ant.-very good owner's manual with frequency guide for ameteur,aironautical,and maritime.-nice case-built very well with good quality feel to it.Things that bug me,but not too much:-Bass and Treble would be nice,but if not CAN'T WE AT LEAST HAVE A TONE KNOB? Not even the famed Sony 2010 has one! Why not?

No usb/lsb.Tunes in 1 Khz steps with bfo ""fine tune"" knob.Still ok for ssb ,just could be better.-no sync detector.Hay,what do 'ya want for that price ?-Cheezy ""earbud phones"". Then again, did you ever get a decent pair of headphones with anything? Not me.Spend a little and get some Koss ""Porta-pro"" phones.You will never go back to cheap ones again!-dial light only stays on for 10 sec.Don't let all of this talk you out of one though.What it does it does well....All in all: A fine little radio esp. for the $. Quite good sound with the speaker,and very very good through phones.Good MW/Am dx( not a 2010 or RF-2200 but,still a lot better than you might think).Good with just the whip ant. for SW.Very good FM.I think it's by far the best radio you can get for the money....grab one while you can still get a new one....8),

27,"I received the Nook as a Christmas present.  I already own a Kindle latest generations, 3g/wifi.  However I soon discovered that not all books are available on the Kindle and 99.9% of the books I couldn't get on my Kindle are on Nook.  After much research I soon learned that if you want good ebook reader you buy either a Kindle or a Nook.  So I asked Santa for it.I will not tell you I like the Nook better than my Kindle or my Kindle better than my Nook.  Both have excellent features that make them both excellent ereaders.Here's a few on the Nook:  1- It keeps the book title, time, and battery charge visible while reading.  2-It starts up just a bit faster than the Kindle.  3-You can use your own photos for the screen saver and wallpaper.  4-it recognizes the table of contents in PDF books.  5-it reads EPUB file types (meaning you can buy books from Borders.com too and read them)As for the Kindle here are a few features I love about it:  1-I like the real keyboard as the buttons are much easier to push than on screen.  2-It reads PDFS much better than the Nook, more so when you have the PDF converted.  3-the page turns are a bit faster.  4-I prefer the black housing to white.  5-the reading page/screen has no glare at all (the Nook's little color panel on the bottom is very reflective) and it seems the print is a little darker.Both the Nook and Kindle are very easy to purchase and load books on.  I think the thing I was most disappointed in with the Nook are the covers.  They are not enough covers that actually close, like the Kindle and when sticking this reader into your purse or bag, you don't want the cover to open and scratch the screen/reading surface.If you are looking for a great ereader, you cannot go wrong with this Nook or the Kindle latest generation, in my book they are both on the top shelf.  Now if we could just get one that is a smashed together version of both their great features into one unit.Update:  After using both my Nook and Kindle for a while now I've decided I do like the Kindle much better than the Nook.  The page turning buttons on the Kindle are very very light touch, the reading screen does have darker print, and the collections feature is top notch.  Now my Nook, the buttons take some pushing to turn the pages, the reading screen is lighter, and the shelves option is ok.  What I don't care for in the shelves feature is I can't colapse the shelves to just show the shelves and then open them when I want to search in them.  I also don't care for the B&N; Library being seperate from My Documents.  On the Kindle these are all included together and you can sort them out using collections.  With the Nook you must use the naviation screen to switch between them.  I've also had some trouble with the navigation screen on the bottom.  I don't have large fingers and don't wear long fingernails so moving around on the screen should be easy.  However, when I'm tryting to scroll or select something on the touch screen I just can't seem to get what I want.  But when I don't mean to move on the touch screen but accidently touch it, I trigger a menu move.  It's still a very good reader, but when comparing options and usability, I'd choose the Kindle any day over the Nook.  I'll purchase most of my books on the Kindle and what isn't Kindlized will go on the Nook.,
","Upon determining that the Apple-brand ear pods included with my iPod were of inferior quality, I opted to have them replaced ASAP.  I assessed my options while remaining conscious of my budget and planned usage of the product, and decided on the Koss ""The Plug"" (or ""Spark Plug"") ear buds.  My other option was the Shure E2C model, as a friend owns these, and they sound phenominal.  However, since I don't foresee myself using my iPod all that often, I didn't up my budget to accommodate these.These headphones are of the ""ear bud"" style, which basically means that a foam/malleable nub is inserted into the actual canal of your ear (as opposed to ear pods, which snugly rest within the exterior of the canal.)  An important thing to know about ear bud-style headphones is that THEY WILL NOT PERFORM AT THEIR MAXIMUM ABILITY IF NOT PROPERLY INSERTED!  Instructions are clearly printed on the back of the package, and if not followed, you will NOT get the best usage out of your product -- in fact, the sound quality very well may sound terrible.To PROPERLY insert these ear buds, the ENTIRE foam nub must be fully compressed (via pinching and rolling with the fingers) and immediately inserted into the ear canal.  Additionally, your best bet is to gently pull your ear canal open by gripping the top of your ear with your thumb and index finger while inserting.  The ear buds then must be held in place (without shoving them in deeper) for approximately 8-10 seconds, while the foam expands into your ear canal, forming a solid fit.  If incorrectly inserted (i.e. not inserted all the way, not compressing the foam prior to insertion, etc.) highs and lows will sound AWFUL, even if you own a pair of $300 ear buds (yes, they do exist.)  Simply put, if you look in the mirror with the ear buds inserted and you can only see the plastic ear pod outside of your ear, then you can pat yourself on the back for a job well done.With that out of the way, the sound output of these rather inexpensive Koss ear buds is very impressive for the price.  The frequency response ranges from 10 Hz to 20 kHz, which is nothing to smirk at.  Distortion is cleverly kept to a minimum at all volume levels except for the very loudest point (I suggest breaking in your ear buds gently before hopping right in and destroying your ear drums.)  The bass output is subtle and effective for the most part, but doesn't perform very well with certain genres of music (while almost all electronic music sounds amazing, bass-heavy rock music or deep rap music may not produce the same satisfaction.)  It should also be known that there literally is no headphone, in-ear or not, that perfectly reproduces all styles of music, and this applies to even the most expensive models.  Any given headphone device will excel in certain categories of sound reproduction, while performing less impressively in others.  (Can you tell I'm an audiophile yet?)The few negativities to speak of are as follows.  The cable, while a decent length (not too short, not too long,) feels rather fragile.  Additionally, the included foam polymer ear buds are on the large side, and may or may not cause some minor to severe  discomfort after extended periods of use (upwards of an hour.)  Thankfully, replacement ear buds can be purchased in multiple sizes at most electronics stores.Overall, if you're finding yourself in the same boat I was and are looking for a suitable replacement for your disappointing Apple-brand iPod ear pods but don't want to break the bank, the Koss ""The Plug"" are HIGHLY recommended for the price.  I haven't heard any other in-ear ear buds in this price range, but I can imagine that these are hard to beat for the money.Just DON'T FORGET TO PROPERLY INSERT THEM EVERY TIME!  Once you get the hang of it, they can be properly inserted and snug in your ears within 15 seconds.  If you don't insert them correctly, they WILL NOT SOUND GOOD AT ALL, and you will have WASTED YOUR MONEY!  I'm a smoker, and even I hate wasting money!  So, educate yourself on in-ear headphones before buying any, and you won't be disappointed.,
","I have many shortwave radios around the house and use them primarily for easy access to many regular AM and FM stations.  I use a Sony SW7600G (black version) as a clock radio because it only has 10 presets per band.  It's how you switch the stations that's important and the YB400PE requires you to key in two digits plus the enter key to change stations--if the memory preset is two digits, why do you have to press enter?  The Sony takes one keystroke (granted, though, the new silver-colored Sony doesn't do this either).  Surely if you're looking for programs on the same shortwave frequencies this is useful, but the frequencies change so much I always use the WRTH and PTWBR books and never use the presets.The sound is much, much better than the Sony.  It has deep bass and clear sound for both speech and music.Aside from choosing memory presets, this radio would be more perfect if it had synchronous detection where the carrier is discarded and a sideband is used for better audio.  The Sony has this and it completely removes interference form RFI sources like computers and fluorescent lamps.Bandscanning is okay if you don't mind the muting every time the frequency changes (some people call this ""chuffing"").  The automatic seek stops on the noisiest frequency, not just one with a carrier.The radio is made in China and has been re-branded as Eton recently.  I have one of the pre-Eton Chinese-made models but I wonder how much better the old Taiwanese version was.***EDIT*** After about four years of daily use the sound has finally deteriorated.  I notice that after about two hours' operation something overheats and the sound becomes muddy and distorted.,

28,"I have been an Amazon fan for a long time. My first attempt at owning a Kindle resulted in two failing devices for which I eventually obtained a refund.My birthday is today; my brother asked me what I wanted two weeks ago and I told him the Kindle. Unfortunately at that precise moment Amazon was right in the middle of rolling out the new Wi-Fi only Kindle and all models were unavailable.  So, I went for the barnes & noble nook Wi-Fi only.Considering my previous experience with the Kindle, I tried not to get too excited. I went on the net to read reviews of the nook and was fearful. I read that it was buggy, that it lagged when you changed pages, that the touch interface was not all that responsive.All of this was wrong; the page turns are quick and do not interrupt the flow of reading.  The touch interface is very nice and I like seeing my book covers in color. When you choose the Cover Flow, your books slide by with the touch of a finger and you simply tap on the book you want to read at that moment.  This was surprisingly helpful when I went to make purchases on the B&N; Store. I know you don't judge a book by its cover, but how many times has a nice colorful packaging led me to a book I wanted to read, uhm; many times. I was really intrigued with the ""swipe"" page turn that you used the touch screen for, however this did not seem to function correctly on the store model or on my own nook. Strangely, after a period of time, it now works perfectly. A representative told me it simply had to adapt to my touch...I don't know how much I trust that statement, however when she turned a page on the display nook it responded to her very well. (Perhaps it was a learning curve?)Side-loading documents: Wow, if you have any epub or pdf documents all you have to do is side load them and voila.  I do recommend a free program called Calibre, which organizes your books, helps you edit the tags, add a color cover, or convert to epub. Pdf is not very easy to read on the nook, but if you convert to epub it goes smoothly, unless there are alot of photos or images, which lessens the accuracy of the conversion. Calibre has even converted files like, Word-Doc, Html, Palm, etc. Calibre will let you pick and choose books to upload to the nook directly from the program; in other words it 'sees' the nook.Drawbacks to the nook: The battery life, that nifty little color touch screen eats the battery power like mad.  B&N; claim that you get 10 days, cut that in half. I do not know if this is because I use the touch screen to do my page turns or not,(the other option being the side buttons) but I am leaning toward, maybe? LCD screens notoriously use power; but using the page turn function does not require the back-light to be on, so I am not sure how it is eating up the battery so badly. It is honestly not that much of a problem for me. I am around my computer so much that it is unlikely a day will go by without it being attached to the CPU or an outlet next to my bed. I have gone almost four days with not re-charging; and I could see that little power icon decrease at least to slightly more than half in that time.Oh - and that nifty little cover flow on the color screen.  Don't expect it to work for Your Documents.  (There are two libraries, the B&N; purchased books and your side-loaded books or documents.) Also there is no way to sort your documents to your specification so you either sort by author, title, or the date you loaded them, very annoying if you build up a nice library; which is highly likely considering you can add an SD card to your nook and increase memory to 16 maybe 32 gigabytes. Speaking of which with that ability to increase memory, it would have been nice if the MP3 Player interface were a little more sophisticated.  An interesting ability is to play an unabridged audio-book and read the book at the same time. I am not sure who would do that, but then again I understand spoken Spanish more than I am capable of reading it.  This might be useful to me in that area, if I can find the matching audio-book/ Spanish-book. (Nuance in foreign language is often lost in English translation.)Never having owned a functioning 3G eBook-reader, I never really missed it with my home Wi-Fi. I have discovered several places close to where I ""haunt"" which have AT&T; free to my nook. I already have a huge collection of books lined up for me to read... so feeling a ""need"" for the 3G seems unlikely. I have always done this, collected books that line up, ready for me to read. (By the way... the in store B&N; Wi-Fi connection has s*cked at every B&N; store I have been to. Amazingly Border's free Wi-fi worked better, I just couldn't buy through the B&N; store. I had to go to my smart phone, buy the book, and it uploaded.)So how do I feel about my nook; I absolutely love it! To be fair however, had I received a functioning Kindle, I would have felt the same way about it, I am certain. I think the Kindle has deficiencies with the lack of a touch/color interface and the side loading documents ability. However, that screen kills the battery as I stated.  The reason for liking the separate touch interface is that you don't want to touch your e-ink screen; I don't see how Sony's all touch interface e-reader is going to be popular when you are smudging your read screen all the time, though I must admit I would like to try one out.The nook is comfortable in all sorts of positions, laying in bed, on the couch, holding it next to you; even laying it away from you and increasing the font so that you could read without holding it. I highly recommend a reading light, especially if you had grown accustomed to reading LCD screens in the dark (my kindle program on my Android phone.)It is rather frustrating, I would have preferred a Kindle simply because I was impressed with Amazon customer service when my Kindle malfunctioned.I do recommend the nook. It would be nice if they would lessen DRM restrictions so I could buy books from Amazon or any other place for that matter.SincerlyR,
","Apparently I have non-standard ears. Normal buds will fall out easily. So I focused my research on in-the-ear buds that would hopefully stay in my ears without constant adjusting. Onto the pros/cons:PROS* Block outside sounds out well. You can stick them in your ears a little for a little sound blocking, or really roll up the foam and deeply embed them into your ears for near silence.* The sound blocking really lends to the quality of the sound output since you hear more of the music and less of whatever else is going on around you.* Produces a lot more sound output at the same volume. I attribute this to cancelling outside noise and channeling all the output right into your ears. Does this benefit battery life since you're running reduced volume? I'd think so, but probably not a noticable amount.* Nice long cord.* Seemingly good quality.* Includes extra foamies.CONS:* You have to sick them INTO your ear. Some people probably would hate this.* They can block virtually all outside noise. Someone could be axe murdering my family while I listen to music with these things and I'd never hear it. Seriously.* If the cord gets tugged on or pulled it can transmit ""noise"" to your ears due to the fact the plugs are IN your ear. This is minor but annoying and it happens to me somewhat frequently since I primarly use this with my Shuffle in the gym.* I find the bass to be muddy. However, this is the case with every earbud I've used. Consider the price of these it's a very minor complaint.,
","Hello radio lovers!  I have  a vast collection of radios and many many years of radio listening and purchasing experience  I can do accurate compares which many find helpful. When I purchased this radio I so wanted it to be great like the old days of Grundig . Its not bad , but I wouldn't go out of my way to reccommend it over others . The Sony sw7600gr and the Sangean ATS909 are much better buys . Here's why , first off the Grundig YB400pe is generally not made very well . The poor quality of the body , the antenna and the sound are obvious upon first look and listen . The tuner sensativity on FM is good but AM and SW are fair . The side band set up is ok , others are better . One draw back is that it takes 6 AA batteries while the others take 4 .This makes the radio very heavy for its size . True that the Sangean 909 and the Sony 7600 are a little more expensive but worth it . You are getting a more durable radio with a much better tuner and better sound . So I guess to sum it up its not that this radio is so bad its that the others in its class are so good.,
"
29,"First off, I want to start out by saying that I love my Nook. My friend is an employee of B&N; so he was there to help guide me along in my selection and answer any questions I had. So, yes, I did have a little bias to the product to begin with. However, for what I need, this is perfect in almost every single way. In my review I'll compare the Nook to the Kindle ($139 version) and it's major differences, just so people know what I'm talking about in terms of other products as we go down the list.The Bad (If you want to call it that):1. The Nook is a little heavier than the Kindle. I'm not sure of the exact weight differences, but just by feel alone it is a tad bit heavier. Now, that can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. I for one don't find it to be a deal buster, the weight is not catastrophically heavier and uncomfortable, but it is heavier than the Kindle. I do think, however, that the durability of the Nook is a little better compared to the Kindle. The Nook has built in paddles to turn the pages, while the Kindle has flappy paddles along the side that feel as though they could break if I dropped it on it's side or if I touched it to hard. My suggestion for anyone interested in buying the Nook is to also buy a carrying case for it so it makes it easier to read, almost as if you were reading a real book. The covers at B&N; usually start around $30.2. The Nook does have a touch screen that has a bit of glare to it. Some others have posted their reviews of how they dislike the glare when the touch screen goes dark. For me it is a bit distracting if you find yourself wandering away from the text. However, whenever I read a book I find many distractions around me while I read. It's not a huge deal in anyway and some have posted if you turn it to the right angle you won't see your reflection. Again, not a deal buster in anyway I wouldn't think.3. The start up time is atrocious. I can't defend this one in anyway. Amish people can put up houses in a faster amount of time before the Nook would have a chance to get to your homepage. Ok, so not quite that slow, but you get the idea. I haven't timed it yet but I'm going to take an educated guess that it takes around 1-1/2 minutes to start up. That is something that should have been addressed from B&N; to begin with. Again, I can't defend this one in anyway.Ok, so what you have all been waiting for: The Good1. The extra storage feature is superb. The Nook comes with a built in 2GB storage space. Enough for most people, 2GB will get most every book you want to read in your Nook with no problem. However, if you are a fanatic reader that has Newspapers and Magazines delivered to your Nook everyday or every week, this can begin to take up space if you don't free it up. But don't fret! The Nook comes with an extra storage slot for your SD card that can hold up to whatever the highest SD card space is out there. The great thing about it is, SD cards are a lot cheaper today than you would have found 3 years ago, so adding space is cheap.2. The Nook has a featured called ""LendMe"". This is something that the Kindle does not have and I'm sure for competition sake will have in the future. This a great, great, great feature to the Nook! If you have any friends, family or co-workers that have a Nook and have a book on theirs that you would like to read, you can hook up wireless or through the computer and Lend them a copy of it for up to 14 days. If you're a fast reader then you can knock out a 500-600 page book in easily 14 days.3. Your county library might be on the list of Nook rentals. In the county in which I reside in North Carolina, our county library is fortunate enough to have a system in which I can rent books for 14 days from the library. This also is something the Kindle does not have. Before I go off on how great the feature for renting books is, I should point out that the library is going to have a limited selection of books for you to rent. I'm a big Thomas Sowell reader and he has approximately 30 books out on the market. However, the county library that I rent from has only 1 book from his selection. So do you're research before you buy a book, your county library might have it already. The feature, as I have seen, is relatively easy to use. You do have to hard wire your Nook to your computer after you download some software, but it's really simple and the kind people at your local county library can assist you on how to do this. In fact our county library had everything we needed in terms of software and directions on their website.4. Finally. You can take your Nook to B&N; and read any book for up to an hour. Recently I went to grab some coffee at B&N; and wanted to read a book on Ireland. Popped open my Nook, connected to the B&N; network (already programmed into your nook for ease), selected the book I wanted to read from the list I searched on, and wam-bam I was reading a book. You can read lots of books on one Nook from their online selection without having to lug 20 actual books that you wanted to compare before you bought.In closing on this review I would say first and foremost do your homework. Go to B&N; or BestBuy and try out the Kindle, Nook and even the Sony Reader. Some will really like the touch screen of the Nook compared to the touchpad of the Kindle, but it's all in what you like. Some will like the fact you can Lend books and some won't.I'm sure I've missed out on something that others would like to know about the product before buying, so if you have any questions please contact me back here on Amazon and I'll try to get to you as quickly as possible.,
","I own a number of different Koss, Sennheiser, Sony and Grado products and I am extremely pleased with them all.  (I truly believe Grado is the best of the four companies but they don't make an In-Ear product.)These ""Plugs"" are good for nothing in my opinion unless one wants to go deaf, get a blistering headache and have ringing in the ears.  The distortion can only be described as a ""sonic bass mudslide"" that overwhelms and perverts all sounds coming through these ""Plugs.""  I am genuinely shocked that Koss would put their name to such a terrible product; perhaps these ""Plugs"" are designed for a younger generation that wants to be deaf by 25 while listening to the type of ""boom boom"" bass that rattles windows?  But these ""Plugs"" are the exact opposite of what an audiophile or anyone else who wants to just ""listen"" and ""hear"" his/her music, books, etc. through headphones.  Before the blistering eight hour headache these ""Plugs"" had given me was through, they were repackaged and shipment was arranged for a refund.  I've never been disgusted by a Koss product before but I feel that I write out my experience as a warning to others.  Audiophiles and music lovers, BEWARE!In terms of In-Ear headphones, I would recommend the updated version of ""The Plug"" known as ""The Spark Plug.""  It doesn't have as long of a cord but they haven't set my teeth on edge or caused headaches such as the one I received from ""The Plug"" and they do offer some passive noise reduction.  I also recommend the Sennheiser In-Ear headphones.  They are more expensive (in the 60-80 dollar range) but worth it if you have the money because Sennheiser does make a better product in my opinion than Koss these days.  The truth is that Sennheiser surpasses Koss on almost everything these days.If you don't like In-Ear headphones (and I'm not much of a fan of them myself with a few exceptions) and don't want to spend more than $[...], the Koss PortaPro, Sennheiser PX-100, PX-200 (awesome and blocks sound!), the iGrado, Grado SR60 (the best for pure sound!), Sony MDR-Q22LP (great little set!) and Koss KTXPRO1 are excellent alternatives that I believe are truly worth five to ten times what they cost.  I hope this was of some help.,
","If you want to convert your VHS video tapes into digital format and don't want to purchase an expensive video capture card, this is an alternative.I've been able to convert VHS tapes into decent MPG, Real, and Microsoft Windows Media files in size 320 x 240, but not without some hassle. As an earlier reviewer pointed out, the software that comes with this product is very buggy and be prepared to spend some time troubleshooting to get it working.Here's my first experience. I use Windows 2000 on a PIII 550Mhz, with 256 RAM and 20 Gig EIDE harddrive. When Dazzle arrived, I followed the directions and installed the software and put the plug in the USB port and then discovered that this software only works with Windows 98. I visited the Dazzle web site and found out that you have to purchase a program called Movie Star is you want to use it with Windows 2000. I wound up ordering the software for [more $] plus shipping. Once, I received the new disk, I installed it, and once again, it did not detect the unit when I plugged it into the USB port. And again, I visited the Dazzle web site. I discovered that they have posted a patch for the Movie Star software that fixes &quot;some minor problems.&quot; I downloaded and installed the patch and after rebooting the machine, I was able to get it to detect the unit.The next step was to get Dazzle to work with my cheap... Mitsubishi VHS player. I was able to get it to work with the S-Video port from my Panasonic DV camcorder, but I couldn't get it to detect the output plugs from the VHS player. Finally after rebooting the machine twice, I got it to work.Next getting the software to work was another challange. despite having a fast machine with a lot of RAM, I found the Movie Star program to be very unstable. I was able to capture up to 60 minutes of video and save it to the MPEG format, but everytime I tried to edit or export the video as Windows Media or Real, it crashed the machine. I downloaded a copy of Ulead's Video Studio, but couldn't figure out how to import MPEG files. I finally bit the bullet and wound up downloading a free 30-day trial of Adobe Premier. I found Premier to be a very stable and easy to use program. I just wish it didn't cost [so much!]For my trouble, I found the output from Dazzle to be satisfactory. You would get better results if you spent big money for video capture card that would let you plug an S-Video cable into the back of your PC. Another better alternative would be to use Firewire. (I always use Firewire with my Panasonic DV camcorder and it works great.)After my experience, I cannot recommend this unit to others. I don't think it's fair that this company charges Windows 2000 users extra $.. for buggy software. And I think they could improve the USB connect so it isn't so difficult to use. I am giving this Unit two stars because it does the job, but only after spending a lot of time and some additional money to make it work.,
"
30,"With these new ereaders on the market, the act of reading has come back to be a very ""in-style,"" technologically advanced and hip thing to do in 2010. Books are now less intimidating and more fun and convenient, and this becomes only more encouraged through Barnes and Noble's Nook.Now, to cut to the chase, the Nook can do most things that the Amazon Kindle can do as well, and while the Kindle holds some ground over the Nook, on an overall scale, if you're looking for a better and more convenient ereader, I'd say to go for the Nook.Both the Kindle and Nook have clear displays, but overall, I would say that the Kindle's display seems to have better resolution. The Kindle also beats the Nook on battery life (as you'll notice that the Nooks battery life seems to last about a week, whereas the Kindle about a month, this is due to the draining power of the Nook's light-up touch screen menu). People may also prefer the button keyboard operation of the Kindle over the Nooks sometimes annoyingly sensitive or not-sensitive-enough touch screen. The Kindle is also thinner and lighter than the Nook. Both have mp3 features though, which helps them. It's always great to be able to read to your favorite music.Now, while it may seem in this paragraph the Kindle has the Nook easily beaten, one must look deeper into finding out why the Nook is a better choice. The reason the nook beats the Kindle is easy - in its navigation, presentation and overall ease of use.The biggest problem with the Kindle (that I noticed) is that the Kindle seems to want to have the look and feel of navigating like a laptop computer in the way it presents the main menu and font size, style and book selection. The problem with this is one thing - this is NOT a computer, it's a portable book, and Barnes and Noble knows this, and made their unit feel way less like just another annoying technological gadget but instead with a ""browsing bookstore"" type of presentation. This is a very BIG difference between the two, and you can sense it even after just a few minutes of toying with it. And this is only talking about the OLDER Nook, I can only imagine how much more amazing of a presentation the color Nook can get with all of its full color pictures and extras.On top of this, the Kindle seems to have placed the turn-page buttons way too attached to the ends, so you actually end up hitting the buttons by accident way too often, whereas the Nooks buttons are more of a soft ""bendable plastic"" type, so you never hit them by accident. This, on top of the little things like being able to slide your finger on the touch screen to turn pages as well as getting book covers and previews, daily logs, etc, give the nook an overall more ""coffee house"" feel which the Kindle doesn't even come close to. And even though the Nook is bulkier and heavier, it actually is made of a more durable softer rubber-like material, and along with the white paneling it makes it feel overall way more professional and studious. Not to mention just more attractive and stylish. This is easily the hipper of the two ereaders. Therefore, things like slightly longer load times, heavier feel, sometimes annoying touch screen and slightly higher price are actually very tolerable once you pick up both units and see and feel the overall difference.Books are an old-fashioned type of entertainment, and while the Kindle tries to make reading and literature just another tacked on 21st century technological piece of unrelatable modernized hardware, the Nook walks the perfect line of bringing the ""old-fashioned"" hobby of reading to a hipper style for the 21st century without taking away the studious professionalism of reading or disrespect the art of literature either. The transition is so much smoother on the Nook that you'll forget you're even reading off of an electronic device.,
","I have recently realized that I am what some like to refer as an ""audiophile.""  I've always loved good sound reproduction, excellent sound range as well as quality.  When I was younger, I used to buy Koss pretty much exclusively.  Lately though, I've been somewhat disappointed though with a few exceptions, the Koss PortaPro being at the top of the list!These headphones have been around since I was a teenager and unlike me, they are still going strong!  They have fantastic sound, they are not overly affected in the bass range (they don't add extra bass for the ""boom boom"" window rattlers out there), they are economical, comfortable and just all around a fantastic buy.  Also, they are recommended by SERIOUS audiophiles as the best portable out there.I can't agree with that entirely; I also recommend the Sennheiser PX-100 and PX-200 depending on your needs.  But of the three, these are the least expensive but offer fantastic sound that you would expect to come out of a pair of full size cans (headphones, I guess I'm learning the audiophile lingo!).The Koss PortaPro have the Comfort Zone temple pads that help make them even more comfortable and the pressure between temple and ear can be adjusted literally by the flick of a switch on ear side of your head.  I have a massive head and these fit me with room to spare.  I like the firmest setting on the Comfort Zone but I've tried the other two settings as well and I can honestly say that there is a difference; it is NOT just a gimmick.  The Comfort Zone really works.These are truly portable also!  They fold up into a little ball that can then be placed into a convenient case that Koss provides.  I personally would recommend buying a semi-hard shell case that Koss also sells just for the extra protection.What more can I say?  If you'd like a few other recommendations in the truly portable range, the Sennheiser PX-100 and PX-200 are rugged, comfortable and highly portable.  (They collapse as well and fit into their own plastic case.)  If you like earbuds, the Sennheiser MX-500 is wonderful with its in-line volume control; the sound is absolutely amazing for something so small.  And finally, the Koss KTXPRO1 is an excellent portable headphone with an in-line volume control.  It uses a Titanium element to drive it.  All of these are great products but ultimately this particular review is about the Koss PortaPro and I really am blown away at how great these tiny portable cans truly are.  I believe you will be too.Though I've become somewhat disillusioned by Koss as I've become a so-called ""audiophile"" (why not just call me someone who really loves good sound to come through good instead of creating a term that sets me apart from everyone else?), I highly recommend these cans to you.  If you are on a budget, you especially can't go wrong.  Remember that Koss guarantees all their cans for life with their ""no questions asked"" guarantee.  It's worth it!  So as my review title states, ""The Koss PortaPro shines in every area.""Oh, one last thing:  Don't listen to people who say these cans are ugly or clunky; they aren't.  The design is what gives the PortaPro its unique sound quality and I personally think they look cool!  Ultimately though, it is the sound that matters, right?  :),
","I don't know about the rest of you but I have been researching products to allow me to play music for about 2 months and I've had a hard time making a decision.  I've looked a mp3, minidisc, and regular cd players.  I finally chose to jump in and buy this mainly because I didn't want the mp3 craze to pass me by :^).  Here's what I think:Styling:  Look good.  It is almost exactly the size of a cigarette box but the depth is about 3/4 less.  The clippable pouch that comes with it is okay but you need to undo the velcro tie to turn it on and completely pull it out to vary the volume.  The pouch is quite cushion-any and probably saved me when I dropped it.  It does feel and look durable.  The blue backlit screen looks attractive.  The mp3 file names scroll across the screen rather slowly but, again, a minor point.Sound:  Apart from the miserable headphones (my main problem was static as the headphone jack swiveled around the entry socket) the sound is good to great.  I wasn't looking for &quot;knock your socks off&quot; sound anyway but I am quite happy with it.  The highest volume setting is not as loud as I'd like it but it doesn't bother me to any great extent.Loading music:  Loading is quick thru the USB port.  I use  RealJukebox Plus (the one that costs money) along with an add-on to manage music loading and I am very happy with it.  I didn't like the Rio Audio Manager but it works fine.  Setup was a piece of cake.  Very intuitive and fast.Memory:  64MB allows me to place almost any CD I have in memory.  I have a mixture of 128KBS and 192KBS sampling rates on my mp3s and at 192 a single CD is about all that fits on there.  The expansion port for memory upgrades will come in handy.Overall:  Nothing really to complain about.  A nice little gadget that I'm very happy with.,

31,"I went from the Sony Reader Pocket Edition (which I really did like) to the Nook after the Wifi only version came out and I do not regret the move.  I love everything about the Nook and BN reader store. The Nook is bigger than the Sony Pocket Reader and after reading the Nook for awhile - I just could not go back to reading something on the Pocket Reader. I like the fact that you can enlarge the print up to extra extra large and choose between several font styles.  I like the clock at the top of the reader so now I don't have to waste my morning reading time on the porch by constantly running in to check the clock in the kitchen to see when I need to get ready for work.  I like the fact that you can look at the covers of the books when you want to pick out what you want to read next.  I like that you can add so much extra space to your device (the Pocket reader only accepted 150 books before freezing and acting up). I really like the fact that you can preorder ebooks which will just download to your device when they are available.  I like the fact that the power cord is $14.99 so I can buy extra (one for home, one for work) - where Sony Reader's power cord was almost $30.00.  I like the fact that I can install my own new battery when the time comes and not have to send my reader off to have it done for me.  I like the fact that if there are any questions about the Nook, I just have to go to a nearby B&N and get the help I need instead of wasting time with emails only to receive vague answers from the techs.  All in all I think this is a wonderful device - exactly what I wanted.  I usually read about three to four books a week and being able to carry my whole library with me is great!  I would definitely recommend this product.,
","I had a friend order this for me a while back from a site and I must say they're still working great. Excellent, audiophile-quality headphones for a decent price. So far, they've held up incredibly well over the year or so I've had them. They're very light and they haven't fallen apart or cracked anywhere at all, but still glad to have the KOSS warranty to replace them if I need to. The carrying case is a bit small so do watch out for that, but they will fit with a bit of finagling. I am a 19 year old college student, so I'm on the go a lot. I keep them in my laptop bag and they fit right in. If I decide I want to be a tool and wear them around my neck, they're nice because they automatically adjust to their smallest headband size, so they fit around the neck more like a choker necklace. I also love getting looks from people. Some comments include:""I like your headphones.""""Those are some wacky ass headphones man.""""Those are nice how much did they cost.""""They sound amazing.""et cetera.Pros:-I personally love the 80's styling.-Fold really small and are very portable. (Duh)-Come with a carrying case that feels very high quality and protects them from me.-The ear cushions themselves do not feel like the cheap foam that I was expecting, they're actually closer to Tempurpedic mattress foam, but a bit less squishy.-They (used to) automatically adjust to your head size without even having to touch them. I'll explain below.-Of course, the best thing, they sound great.Cons:-They fold small, but not flat. The headphones are still as thick, when folded, as the diameter of the ear pieces and such. I really wish they folded flat, that would make these truly great.-They don't FEEL all that well made. (But have held up thus far)-Over the course of the year or so I've had them, the metal headband part has bent slightly, but I imagine it's from the times I've tried to fold them up too small, so be aware of that, I'll explain below.-They will make your ears ache after a while (an hour or so).Meh:-I don't like how small the carrying case is, if it wasn't so well made, I'd think I was going to rip the seams or something when putting my 'phones away. Actually, it's not the case itself that's too small, as I can fit my MP3 player in the bag as well, but the opening. It doesn't open very wide. Be careful not to snag anything when putting them away.-Price is pretty cheap, but not exceptional, but I can't complain.-They don't noise cancel, but they're not noise cancelling headphones. I put this here because it's both good and bad. I like hearing my music in peace, but I also like being able to talk to my friends without having to remove my left earpiece from my ear. So they're okay for that.-They have a comfort setting on the sides, it's a switch you have to work. No, it is not an electronic switch for ""bass boost"" or anything like that, so don't get all excited. It's a mechanical switch that basically pushes the pieces against your head tighter. If you have it on the light setting and you move/fold the 'phones inward though, it'll automatically jump to the firm setting I think. It's kinda gimmicky, but it does adjust the tension SLIGHTLY. This will not prevent them from hurting your ears after a long period.So, as you can see, my cons and such are mostly about certain ""bonus"" features of the headphones. As a pair of headphones, they're the best I've ever had.Okay, so as I wrote above, there are two things I have to elaborate on:-Self adjustment: When I first bought these headphones, I could hold one side with one hand and simply lower them onto my head, and they would self adjust like some piece of alien technology. Neat. Well, it's been a while and, while I do my best to take care of my technology, all the folding/unfolding of them, due to the nature of the design, has bent the headband slightly out of the almost-perfect circle it used to be in. It does NOT look any different aesthetically, but it inhibits the little self-adjusting magical fairy gnomes from doing their job as well as they did originally. And by ""little self-adjusting magical fairy gnomes,"" I mean ""those black things on the metal headband that guide it through."" Anyhow, not a huge deal, as it's still very easy to adjust.-Folding the headphones: As I've said above, the constant folding/unfolding of the headphones will (if you're not careful and you accidentally and repeatedly fold them up too tight without knowing) bend the metal headband to the point where it won't self-adjust as easily as it originally did. So, I'm going to help you figure out how to fold them, so you can avoid bending your pair on accident. Okay, so, it's pretty easy to do. The large plastic black pieces that hold the headphones fold inward. Fold them as if you were pushing them into your ears. They will swing into the center of the arc of the headphones about the little piece with the oval-shaped head cushions. Now, on each side of the hinge area, there is a loop and a hook. I don't remember which side is which, but you'll see it. It's the end of the metal headband. Hook the ends into the ends, and you'll have a nice neat circle. Now, you can move the little black slider pieces toward where you just hooked the headband to itself, but DO NOT GO TOO TIGHT. This is how you will bend them. I would say you can slide them about an inch and a half away from the hinge where the earpieces fold in. Now you should be good to go and they'll stay nice and folded.Anyhow, that's about all I have to say. These are well worth the money. I don't use them at home, because I have larger, more comfy headphones for that, but if I'm out? This is all I use. I generally hate earbuds, I always have, so this is how I listen to my music if I go out anywhere.,
","The Rio is overall a great product. The buttons and &quot;interface&quot; on the player itself are for the most part intuitive (though it took me some time to figure out the more &quot;advanced&quot; features) and are  easy to use, even when you're fumbling around in your pocket to change a  song.The fact that the player is unskipable (it's not like MiniDisc  where they SAY it doesn't skip and it really does) and extremely  lightweight makes the Rio the perfect exercise companion; I take it on  every run.For 99% of purposes, 64 megabytes memory is enough (unless  you're a fan of 256 kb encoding). I can almost always fit ten or more songs  on the player, and changing them is easy enough. So don't worry about the  memory size-it's enough.The software (I use a Macintosh) is well done  and makes it very easy to transfer songs to the player itself. The only  thing I was less than perfectly happy with was the wait while the songs  copy (in the scheme of things, a very small flaw). The USB interface was no  problem at all, even on an older, less compatible iMac (Revision A).The  headphones included with the player are neat looking, but not great  sounding. The fidelity is low, with barely any low and low-mid-range sound.  Assume you will have to spend at least another $25 for decent  ear-buds.The only feature I feel the Rio lacks is recording capabilities  like the Nomad. But again, no big deal.Overall, a great product. I'd buy  one for a friend.,
"
32,"I knew about the NOOK Color even before it was released and I was really excited about this ereader, because I own a Kindle 3 and I'm part of the customers that think that it could offer more things and be more en par with the future. The NOOK Color has many features that appealed to me like touchscreen, vivid view technology, brightness adjustments, really nice web browser and mp3 player, etc. So I decided to order one with BlueProton cause they ship it to Canada, and I paid 60 dollars more than the actual price at B&N; and expedited shipping taxes on top of that. I didn't care, I just wanted my NC cause honestly I'm just tired of buying AAA batteries for my Clip light to read my Kindle 3 in bed. I noticed I never read in bright sunlight, I'm an indoors type of reader and I also like to browse while I read, mostly wikipedia and google and the Kindle we browser is primitive.Anyways, I got the NC promptly, I was super excited, but then I tried to transfer my epub books to it and noticed that my computer didn't recognize the unit's drive. Nothing popped. I had my iphone and my kindle plugged in and they were right there. I went to a friend's house and nothing popped on his computer either. A third try at a different laptop and same thing: nada. I went back home and kept trying and all of a sudden I started seeing smoke coming out of the USB port and a smell of burned toast. Really strong. I knew that unit was gone and that freaked me out. Everything else worked perfectly, but the USB was pooched. I returned it and they were very professional about it, but said that they found nothing wrong with the device. I bet they just reset it and tested ome of the features without actually testing its hardware. Anyways, I said I didn't want that unit back. Now here I am, with no Nook Color, nobody else sends it to Canada. I'm contacting friends in the US so I can send it to them, buying it straight from B&N; and then they can mail it to me. It's just weird that at this day and age we still can't have items shipped internationally, even when we're willing to pay more money for that luxury.Now I'm again using my Kindle like crazy, since it's all I got and it never fails. But I'm still gonna buy the NC no matter what. I just don't know if I'll sell my Kindle 3 in the future or keep it because it has sentimental value now, hehe.I think that for 249 US dollars, the NC is the best e-reader in the market. Right now the Kindle still leads and the iPad is coming strong, but 2011 will be the year the Nook Color will establish itself as a great competitor for these other two. If Amazon doesn't come up with a color Kindle with touchscreen, I strongly believe they will be the Betamax and VHS of the 2000s. But I really like the Kindle and if they came up with something like a reader's tablet, I would use it instead of using B&N;'s. However, that still hasn't happened and Jeff Bezos says he doesn't want that to happen just now. So I'll purchase a Nook Color and be happy with it.,
","Take what other reviewers have said about these headphones, believe them, and then multiply it by 100. I received a pair of Koss UR-20s as a gift years ago and loved them  so naturally I looked to Koss again when replacing my portable/on-the-go headphones. After buying a pair of KSC-55s, which sounded great but were uncomfortable for me personally, I hopped on Amazon and found everyone raving about the PortaPros. I figured they were good, especially considering that the design seems unchanged since the 1980s (which has to mean something), but I also figured that this was one of those things that was just too good to be true. However, these are bar-none the most amazing headphones I have ever put on my head. Listening to some of my favorite songs for the first time was one of those 'wow' moments where you realize you have found something that changes your expectations completely. The bar will be raised the instant you hear the bass response and incredible acoustic qualities of these light, comfortable headphones.I don't know what I'm impressed with the most: the amazing bass, the excellent stereo division, or how loud they can get! These things are just as amazing as most of the reviews show them to be and then a lot more... I was worried about the eighties styling, but in person they don't look bad at all. I hate headphones that scream for attention, but these don't look like that when you have them on and I have already been wearing them in public (something I didn't think I would do after only seeing the picture of them online). And even if they're a bit outdated in appearance, the design is so functional you won't even give looks a second thought after you put them on.One thing is for sure: these things have plenty of bass! Not too much (not ""boomy""), but they seem properly tuned for listening to things without ""bass booster"" turned on, which I like. Even with the bass settings adjusted high, the bass remains clear and crisp. I'm not sure how much power these can handle without damaging them, but I listen to them very loud and they do not sound distorted or stressed at all. After a few days my left speaker began making some weird noises and it ended up being a hair stuck inside the headphones that I cleared out with canned air. Something important to consider is that these are very open and airy headphones and the treble carries very well outside the headphones (so someone nearby could definitely hear what you're listening to if you have the volume up loud).Others have mentioned that they felt the headphones were too tight feeling, but I have a very large head and they fit me without a problem. However, if I will be wearing them for an extended period of time I always set them to the ""Light"" setting on the comfortZone control (which divides the side pressure of  the headphones with your temples rather than just on your ears).I already had headphones I was pleased with (Sony MDR-G52s and Koss UR-20s) but I wanted a set of small, portable headphones for use with my laptop and these are perfect. The folding design isn't something I necessarily wanted, but it is nice. The carrying case they come with (a leatherette bag) is a slightly tight fit and I probably won't end up using it much since it is not a hard case that would protect them from shock or crushing. Some others have mentioned that they feel delicate or are easily broken, but compared to other small headphones I have had they seem very well built and equally strong considering their light weight.While I wouldn't say these are bad things about the PortaPros, it is worth mentioning that the headband is metal and will occasionally snag a hair as you adjust it on your head, and that they don't fold down as small as you might think they would so don't expect to put them in your pants pocket or something. Considering these are the worst things I can come up with to say about the PortaPros, they are nearly perfect in my book.I can't say enough good things about these PortaPros! They're simply amazing. These are the first headphones (or speakers) I've had that sound absolutely awesome without adjusting the equalizer or pumping up the bass. They sound good on everything from R&amp;B to Country and everything in-between. I've been especially impressed that they pull the bass and highs out of a song without getting that shrill, tinny treble that plagues so many headphones. If there ever was a question about the quality of Koss stereophones in my mind, these PortaPros have put it to rest and made me into a lifetime customer! If you're like me you'll wish you had discovered these legendary headphones (haha! how often is that said?) years ago...,
","This camera takes okay pictures and it's very easy to use. Don't be repulsed by other reviewers who doesn't know how to use the camera, just go to your nearby retailer store and look at it yourself. It is in some ways  over-priced due to the zoom and floppy drive; a 10x zoom (optical) with a  640x480 is better than a 6x zoom(2x optical and 3x digital) with 1280x960.  I don't like it when people compare these kind of cameras to other kinds at  the same or lower price using flash cards or smart media, because there are  different essentiel accessories that aren't included in those prices(the  compact flash cards could make you say &quot;Aaaarrrrrggghhhh! I don't have  enough because I spent every penny on the camera!&quot;).At the end,  this camera still has problems with the quality of the pictures, but it  comes cheaper than other cameras. If you have a lot of money to invest,  don't buy this one, just buy the best camera with the best lens and don't  look at lower priced items, because quality is what you want.Last thing  to say to whom never touched a digital camera, you must know how the camera  works and how and when it take good or even excellent  pictures.Congratulations to those who bought mavicas(me!)!,

33,"I have been working on my fiction writing skills, and wanted an eBook reader so that I could read a variety of other novels to learn from them.  The Kindle is a great device, but I really wanted a color screen.  The iPad would have been a nice option, but was a bit expensive for my taste and a bit too large.  The myriad Android tablets on the market don't seem to get great reviews, though I suspect that will start to change once Android 3.0 is available.The Nook Color was a nice alternative.  Priced a little higher than some of the no-name Asian tablets, but far less than the iPad.  It supports multi-touch, has a decent color display, and the ability to insert micro SD cards into a slot near the ""loop"" on the bottom.Because it supports both ePub and PDF out of the box, you can find a nice selection of books to download (legally) on the web and read on the device without additional investment.  The Barnes and Noble site also offers a limited, but growing, selection of electronic books (both free and for-a-price).  If you get tired of reading, you can use the built-in WiFi and browser to surf the web.  You can also play a couple of the built-in games, with the promise of more coming in a future update from Barnes and Noble.My only complaints so far about the device are that the far edges of the touchscreen seem a little unresponsive, the micro-USB connector is a non-standard type that seems to require use of the proprietary cable.  The connector on the device itself seems to make poor contact with that cable, which makes it difficult or impossible to read on the device while it's charging.Apart from that, battery life has been really good.  I rarely have to plug it in before I am finished reading for the day.The built-in web browser works well, displaying pretty much any web site that an iPad or Android phone can handle.The WiFi seems to find and hold on to signals well, and I don't recall it dropping a connection so far.If you take the time to learn how to ""root"" the device, you can add the Android Market to it and many apps (like the Kindle app) work very nicely on it.  This gives you the best of both worlds in a sense... The ability to buy eBooks from Amazon and Barnes and Noble, while keeping your color display.As far as eye strain goes, I work at computers 8 or more hours a day on the job and more when I get home.  I find the Nook's display easy to read for hours at a time and don't feel that my eyes are any more strained than when I read a printed paper book.  But your mileage may vary.  If e-Ink works better for you, the Kindle is a great alternative.I like the ability to highlight parts of the books I'm reading, take notes inside the book as I read (e.g., to highlight particularly good dialogue, characterization, description, etc., as a writer), and to post updates to Twitter and Facebook about your progress through a book.All in all, this was my favorite 2010 Christmas gift and has (for me) eliminated any desire to own an iPad or any other eBook reader.,
","Purchased these June 13, 2013. I was tired of my son breaking my expensive headphones and decided to try these as they looked industrial strength.  They do the job and didn't cost that much.  You will have to adjust the equalizer settings on your PC or whatever you use these for as they don't seem to be quite right with the neutral settings of most devices.  I like the wire on one side only, but I don't care for the constant adjusting that is required; they seem to reset to shorter way more easily when I set them down than when I try to lengthen them when putting them on.  I also don't care for the bulkiness; it would seem that they would be somewhat noise canceling just by the size, but no such luck.  For the money though, they work as well as could be expected.Update August 30, 2013: So much for durability; used them today and they broke. The size adjustment things on the head band broke.  I am careful with my usage of anything I buy and am very disappointed with only 2.5 months of use.  A close look at the adjustment fittings show that they are of low quality.  Definitely will never buy Koss again.,
","For entry level digital photography, you could do far worse than the Mavica.  What sold me initially, aside from the very reasonable price, was that it used floppy discs instead of internal storage.  What this means is that if you have a pocket full of discs you can take pictures all day without ever having to download to your PC.  It also means you don't have to worry about a free parallel, serial or USB port, which, if you're a peripheral junkie like me, is reason enough to give serious consideration to this camera.On the downside - yes, there is one - the resolution is not what you might hope for.  When used at normal size, the pics are fine, not great.  They're useable.  When you try to increase the size to 5x7 or 8x10, the results are disastrous.  The other downside is that the flash will frequently wash out the entire picture, but the camera does not function well indoors with available light.  You really have to fiddle with your settings to get this right.  Sometimes it's just not possible.So, do I recommend this camera?  Yes, with reservations.  If you're looking for high quality output and you have the bucks to spare, then look elsewhere.  But if you want a decent camera for a reasonable price, particularly for outdoor use, check out the Mavica.,
"
34,"I didn't buy this to be an e reader but as a small tablet PC, and I was rather surprised with how well it works. I'm using it much more than I thought I would. Most of the time I use an aftermarket Android OS (CyanogenMod) booting off a micro SD, there's no need to root or jail break the stock firmware to do this. With the aftermarket firmware, it also has Bluetooth, the micro USB can be used as a host USB with an adapter or USB gender changer, and it will charge the battery while plugged in to a PC's USB, normally it will only charge with the wall charger.My biggest complaint with the stock firmware is B&N;'s app store, the apps are fairly pricey, apps that are free elsewhere you have to pay for, there are a few free apps from B&N; but not many. With the aftermarket firmware I'm using the Amazon app market, much better selection and prices.Cons: The sound is about what I expected, fairly poor, but is greatly improved by using an amplified external speaker. The micro SD slot is in a very poor location making it very difficult to insert and remove, it's located under a hinged cover behind the loop in the lower left corner, it's well protected there, just not easy to access. Don't expect to watch streamed HD video, however, sites like YouTube work fine.Despite the cons, I give 5 stars, I think it's a great value, I have been very pleased with it.,
","I've had mine for three years now, and I find the UR20s indispensible, since I live in an apartment and can't turn the TV up to a decent level otherwise. There's reasonable bass; you would expect so for the size of them. Always look at the specs. The low number is the bass, the high number (usually in the tens of thousands) is the treble. This set's bass is 30 Hertz. That's That's not a bad number; 20 is average, 12 would be phenomenal. The treble is set at 20,000 Hertz. Theoretically, only dogs can hear frequencies above that, but I think a headphone with a figure over that just seems to sound brighter in the treble, which is what I like. I hate unclear treble and muddy, distorted bass. Another number you look at is sensitivity; the better ones are always over 100. So, I guess based on the specs, these 'phones are about average.The cord length is excellent at 8 feet. I can be a reasonable distance away from the TV without straining the cord; I've even slept with them on without ear fatigue.These headphones make movie watching a whole new experience...you get surround sound without the expense!I've had a great experience with the UR20s and I recommend them for use with home theater, even if you just have a 20&quot; portable like mine. You need an adapter to plug them into a home stereo, and there's plenty of cord where you can be either reasonably mobile or you can sit in your favorite chair some distance away. I think they're great. The only thing that would make them the best is better specs, and that's hard to find at this price range.,
","This little ""convertible"" isn't much bigger than some CB microphones. I'm particularly pleased with the three modes of power; AA batteries, NiMH rechargeables, or 12v vehicle. The mobile vehicle adapter includes both a plug-in cigarette lighter power point and a coax connector for an external antenna. I use the Midland 18-2442 magnetic mount (it will tune to SWR of about 1.5 on channels 1 and 40) to significantly increase the range to several miles, depending on conditions. As a mobile radio, it works pretty well given that it's a one (small) size fits all type of unit. But what I really got this for was to use it as a handheld walkie-talkie. And that's where it truly shines. The provided rubber duckie antenna is nice and short, but it severely limits your transmit range. Use it if you don't need to talk more than a couple hundred yards. I mounted the Cobra HA TA telescoping whip antenna and got a tremendous increase in performance. Battery life is pretty good. The rechargeables will last all day with reasonable usage. Plug it into the charger overnight and you're ready for the next day. The weather alert is a nice feature, too.All in all, a very useful small radio that really comes to life when connected to a decent antenna. Recommended for those who need a versatile CB for automobile and handheld applications.,
"
35,"I purchased two certified nook colors directly from B&N;, for my kids to read ebooks on, and for some entertainment on long trips, Dr's appts, etc.Things I like about the device:-versatility- now has netflix- great little device for entertainment, as well as reading.-user interface:  much improved following the last update, both navigating the device itself and B&N;'s store.-option for expandable storage- handy for music and mp4's.-ability to make the device 'kid friendly'; the internet can be disabled, and purchases can be made to require your account password.Things I dislike about the device:-Read in store feature only for certain books, and virtually no kids' books.  The impression I got from B&N;'s webpage was that it was for all ebooks.  This was the main reason why I picked these up instead of waiting for the Kindle Fire to be released.  Major disappointment.-Charger cable sucks.  The cable itself is weak where the usb adapter attaches to the cable, and is very easy to bend and break.  one cable is now broken at that spot, and the other is close to it.  These cables are easily replaceable, so not a huge deal, but I expected better quality...  Also, the power adapter is quite bulky.-did not update automatically.  I had to manually install the most recent update (allowing me to disable internet, and install netflix). it was relatively easy to do, following directions from B&N;'s webpage, but there should be a way to check for updates from the device itself.-loses battery life fairly quickly while on standby.-no free games & limited games (maybe apple spoiled me...)-prices for apps and books seem generally higher than on my kindle (I have not made direct comparisons, this is just my general impression)I will try and see if I can lend books through my local library; this may allow me to use it more for it's intended purpose.Overall, the device itself is quite good- just not for what I had intended it for (in store reading- with the option to purchase the book, in print, from the store).If I had purchased the device for myself, however, it would have been returned.  My kids do enjoy reading on it, playing angry birds, watching netflix, etc. so I will keep it for their use.Edit:The nook colours use a usb longer than a standard micro usb; a standard micro usb cable will not charge the nook colour.  I did contact B&N; (I initially took my nooks into a B&N; store for assistance, and was referred to their tech support 1-800 number.  So much for the in store tech support...)  I was able to recieve two new cables under warranty, though.I am generally happy with the tech support provided over the phone, but am still disappointed by the quality of the charging cable, and the inability of B&N; to solve this issue in-store.,
","I have bought 3 pairs of sporta pros during the last 3 years. (Nothing wrong with the quality, just I like to have one pair at home, one pair at office and another pair stuffed in my backpack)It looks fragile and sometimes ugly. But what really counts is the sound. The characteristics of the sound are: clean, warm, dynamic (overs a wide range from low to high), very good sensitivity (very loud at normal volume setting), lots of bass (although a little boomy at times). The first time when you hear it you will be surprise for its powerful bass. I hate the mute button but I heard recently Koss had taken it off. For protable use it's probably the best in its price class. Some people complain about the comfortability issue, I have no problem wearing it for hours though.For more serious listening, I would highly recommend a pair of Grado SR60 (open style). It's about $70 and I couldn't believe how much pleasure I had taken from listening to it. The highs are crystal clear, the bass is good but not boomy at all (you can feel it), the warm, open mid range is simply seductive. The transparency and spacious of the sound stage is amazing. It stirs up your feelings and emotions when listening to most vocal, classic and pop music. It's pity that Amazon.com doesn't carry this headphone, truely a gem in the protable headphone family.Another pair (closed style, around $70-80) I could recommend is Sony's MDR-V6. Good frequency range, very good bass, very clean sound and very little coloration of sound. However unlike the grado, the sound is flat although maybe more accurate. I will describe the sound as ""scientific"" comparing with grado's ""emotional"" and ""liveness"".,
","My product came packaged neatly in a clear plastic bag. Comes with two keys with bright orange tags. and a Paper Manual with the code to replace your keys if you ever lose them. Never got the link to the site to work, so codes were practically useless.The cable has two different ends. One end has a lock and attaches to your laptop and the other end is a loop.The end with the lock can swivel, so the lock revolves around the end if the cable ever gets tangled.I wrap the cable around the leg of my desk and pull it through the loop. This way, unless someone has a cable cutter or enough strength to rip the leg off the desk, they should not be able to steal the physical laptop. Unless they were aiming for the Hard Drive, graphics card, or DDR3 RAM; that would be a different story.Cable is almost no different than the heavy duty bicycle security cables. It has a diameter of roughly ~&#60; 1 cm. So a decent cable cutter can cut the cable in half.This is only a simple way to ward off thieves in a very basic environment. Better than nothing.&#62;&#62;&#62;Final Thoughts&#60;&#60;&#60; I only got this since I needed to use my laptop on my desk at my part-time job, and I can't be bothered constantly locking my laptop in the cabinet every time I step away from the desk.Keeps thieves from stealing your entire laptop. If they were aiming at the components of your laptop, all they need is a Phillips screwdriver and plastic gloves. Or if they had a good compact cable cutter, which nowadays are quite small.For ~$31, not a bad deal. TO me was better than a retractable cable as those are weaker and thinner. The long cable is good if I ever needed the extra length.Fits in my ASUS 15.6 inch N53SV-EH72 laptop and my Acer 14 inch V5-471P-6498 laptop.May recommend to others, I don't know how long it would keep thieves off my laptop but something is better than nothing. :D,
"
36,"I've held off on an e-book reader for a long time. The Kindle was always too expensive and, even now, I don't like the way the screen flashes when ""turning"" pages. After playing around with many different readers, over a period of several weeks, I finally decided to pick up a Nook a couple of months ago.One of my big considerations is that I wanted to be able to read .pdf files in color. The Nook easily satisfied that requirement. What I was expecting; however, is how FANTASTIC the Nook is after Android is installed on it. A friend of my just bought a new iPad 2 and showed it to me a couple of days ago. That, of course, is a wonderful device but VERY expensive. I started to look around the 'net and found that the latest Android Operating System, Honeycomb, can be installed on a micro-SD memory card and that this will allow the Nook to run the new OS. Even better, by simply removed the micro-SD card, the Nook returns to it's normal state and continues to run as before.I had NO IDEA how powerful the Nook Color really is until I installed Honeycomb on it. The Nook is now so great that it behooves me that B & N doesn't simply place Android on the Nook as the default OS! Yes, it's its that good! Just one word of caution. As using Honeycomb doesn't require that the Nook be rooted, it is a bit tricky to install but that's only due to the HORRIBLE instructions that the geeks who discovered how to put Android on the it. (As a rule, Geeks are usually incapable of writing in known-human languages.) I don't know if the warranty is voided by running Honeycomb but, as all that needs to done to get rid of it, is remove the micro-SD card, I suspect that no one will know.All in all, the Nook Color was already a great device but adding Honeycomb makes it AMAZING!,
","Had I waited, this would have been the one.  I have the Rebel G, and it has been a great camera.  Having worked in larger, non-automatic formats, I really felt kind of like a &quot;cheater&quot; when I got my new Rebel.  One roll of film was all it took to make a convert of me.  I have rarely been disappointed with my photos.  In fact, the only time I have been, I was really stretching my photographic wings, and had I read the manual more carefully, would not have been disappointed had I followed the directions.My sister-in-law bought the Rebel 2000 this spring, and I didn't think they could improve much on the one I have, but they did.  Trying to focus on confusing images, such as framing wildlife with nearby foliage, can be challenging. The 7 point automatic focusing is a real plus in this respect.  I have learned to work without it, but the advantage of the system allows for quicker capture of images without the need to compose and then re-adjust to the frame you want.Because the camera is so well-made, I will probably not need to replace it for another 20 years.  But---if it should somehow meet with an early demise, the improvements in the new Rebel 2000 would be very welcome!,
","This card may be fine for just watching TV on your PC, but for video capturing, the quality is horrible. You cannot capture above 240 pixels height-wise, and this severely limits the card in my opinion. I was expecting 480x480 capture ability (Which is present in their much much older product, the ATi All-In-Wonder.. over 4 years old!), but did not find any. Add on to that the fact that the MPEG1/MPEG2 encoding is done through software (not hardware), and horribly at that.. the card just isn't worth the price tag.Perhaps the only good part about this product was that the install went smoothly. Well, kind of. The package doesn't contain software for Windows 2000. You have to go to ATi's website and download beta software/drivers. It takes about 3 reboots to get the card installed completely in Windows 2000. No biggie.If you want a decent capture card, either get an ATi All-In-Wonder Radeon, or wait for nVidia's new &quot;Personal Cinema&quot; to come out (supports everything the AIW does, plus it has a remote, and you can view both TV/VGA at the same time!) I think I'll just save up my money and get a Sony DV &lt;-&gt; Analog converter box. Now that's quality.,
"
37,"I haven't really given up my Kindle (which I love and has its advantages). However, I got a deal on a Nook Color that was impossible to ignore and so I made the jump. If you're wondering if it's worth 2X the price, IMO it depends on your needs and wants. For people who want to create an inexpensive e-reader/Android tablet by rooting the Nook -- or if you love to read periodicals or books with lots of images -- the Nook Color is the way to go.It's surprisingly heavy to hold -- MUCH heavier than my Kindle with a cover. The battery life means you CAN'T be far away from an electrical plugin. My last charge lasted 2+ days with playing games, an animated screensaver and some reading. It's also wireless only.The backlit LCD screen is spectacular and I find it was better on my eyes for reading than I expected. However, I find that finding ebooks on B&N;'s site is harder than Amazon and I cannot find many inexpensive or the oodles of free ebooks like for Kindle. Lots of ebooks promoted on B&N;'s Nookstore are $4.99 - $9.99 or more. Too expensive, IMO. Seems like fewer Indie Authors on there in the $2.99 price range :(I decided to take a chance and rooted my new Nook Color which requires a micro SD card (I used a 2G card). It requires the ability to follow some technical steps that took me about 15 minutes total. I am not a major Geek, but I've been online for 15 years and know basic stuff like HTML (not needed for this) and moving files and some troubleshooting if I get stuck. The Rooted Nook is a bit quirky. While the original B&N; e-reader functionality is still there, I had to install a couple apps (launcher app and Softkeys) to toggle between the Android and B&N; screens.I CAN watch YouTube and surf the web easily. I also downloaded the Amazon Kindle app to my rooted Nook, and read my 100+ Kindle books on it (and get my freebies too!). You can't view Flash or use Hulu or Netflix (yet!), but maybe flash will work with the next B&N; update. note that a Nook Color doesn't have a mic or bluetooth to use with certain Android apps. A bummer for me because I like to dictate texts and emails on my phone using Nuance's FlexT9 app.Overall, my kids **love** the Android side of the rooted Nook Color, and I like getting some useful apps on a much bigger screen. So now we fight over it. Will I get rid of my Kindle -- no way. But I find the Nook Color becoming more my at home reader with the Kindle app on it, and my Kindle device turning into an away from home, travel e-reader.,
","But the fact is, I use the automatic setting 99.9% of the time. It is a nearly a fool-proof camera that takes perfect pictures almost every time. (I own the Canon Rebel G - very similar to the Canon 2000, but purchased in  1998)And I hate to confess this too, but...I take photos professionally.  (people pay me for my photos and they are published in the print media and  on the Internet)Shameful, I know, but it's true. With my little Canon  Rebel, I put the little thingie on the automatic setting, point, pause (let  the camera make its best decisions) and then shoot. I then drop the film  off at the local camera shop. (first few times, I had to take the whole  camera in because I wasn't sure how to unload and reload the film, although  that's pretty easy too)When I pick up the photos, they are just  beautiful. Now, I have had to learn some hard lessons about camera flash  and shadows, but that is hardly the camera's fault. Experience has taught  me a lot, there.In summary, I am not a camera person. I don't *want* to  be a camera person. But my Canon Rebel has paid for itself many times over  from the photos I've sold. It combines the best of modern electronics with  photographic excellence.And it has a dazzling display of options for  those who want to play with all the fancy features. But for me - I'm  sticking with the automatic thingie.I would highly recommend this camera  to others.THREE different people (that I know of) have bought this  camera, after watching me use it and then seeing the end results. (under  the &quot;good grief, if she can take good pictures, anybody can&quot;  philosophy.)They were all astonished that someone who knows so little  could take such incredible photos.Only downside - it is a delicate  camera. No forgiveness factor on dropping it. I use the STRAP faithfully.,
","I wanted to give ""The Plug"" a fair shot, so I bought a pair.  First of all, everything you have read about the stock foam earpieces is true; they are worthless.  The foam expands way too fast for you to compress it, shove it in your ear, and have it expand to get a good seal.So I followed some of the recommendations given in the reviews here, and modified some roll-up foam earplugs.  Now at least they will stay in my ears.I am recommending that people spend a little more money and buy the Sony MDR-EX71SL Fontopia earbuds, and here's why:-They seal really well to your ear canals, once you have selected the proper size silicone adapter.  The result is excellent bass.-You can put them in and pull them out really quickly.  On insertion, they just go in and seal, there is no waiting around for the foam to expand and seal.  You can quickly yank one or both of them out, and be able to plug them right back in.  This is really a good thing if you want to use them at work.-The sound of the Sony earbuds is just plain superior to the Koss'.  Really, it is.  They are worth twice the money of the Koss', which is about what they cost.About the only reason I may keep the Koss' around is that, with my foam earplug modification, they probably block more ambient noise than the Sonys, and they seem to be more efficient (more volume for a given drive level).  These two factors make them a good candidate for use when I am riding my motorcycle.  If it weren't for this, I wouldn't even consider them over the Sonys.,
"
38,"Pros:1). Excellent color screen2). Firmware Update to Android Froyo 2.1 allows for minor expansion of capabilities3). Responsive touch screen during reading4). Good, sturdy construction5). Exapandable memory with MicroSD card slot6). Weight is slightly heavy, but not too bad at all.Cons:1).  Although it can play videos on the internet, videos are otherwise extremely hard to find that fit the format for the player.  For example, Amazon.com Instant Video plays .wmv files, which is not a compatible format.  Converting these files to another format is next to impossible, since Amazon.com instant video doesn't support the Nook Color.  Amazon.com, CinemaNow (through Best Buy), and even Itunes movies are all DRM protected and won't run on the Nook Color due to lack of support (trust me, I've tried them all).2).  Not connected to Android app store...Barnes and Noble currently (as of 5/11/11) only has 148 apps in their ""Nook Apps Store"".Overall: B+The Color Nook is a great e-reader with inernet capabilities and limited android Apps.  Although a Android Firmware update was released in May 2011, the limitations of the device can be seen through lack of impressive apps and extreme lack of ""Other-than-internet"" video playback, put the Color Nook down a coulpe of notches in my book.  Overall though, this is an impressive e-reader for the novice user who is looking for a light travel device that can offer internet connectivity and decent battery life.,
","Like many online reviews and even Wikipedia describe this camera, the FM-10 is a entry level film camera. Still, even though it lacks any kind of automation and (more important IMHO) a ground-glass pentaprism viewfinder (extremely important for depth-of-field preview with lenses faster than f/2.8), I believe that this camera is as good as any other SLR film camera. Furthermore, I doubt that any beginner or even more serious amateur photographer who would choose film over digital, has a desire for high automation features in such a camera. The FM-10 (manufactured by Cosina in Japan and sold under the Nikon brand) has a built in light-meter that requires two small batteries (provided with the camera) and is operated by a separate button on the slightly upper left side of the lens. Operating the meter button does require a shift in what would be the most natural and safest left hand grip of the camera, so that holding the camera in a steady position while using the light meter button becomes a bit uncomfortable, but that probably only goes for people with smaller hands like myself. Since most modern light meters suffer from a  biased factory calibration (meaning they would fail the grey card test), I am yet to run some appropriate tests as to check the accuracy of this light meter's calibration. On the positive side (and the right side of the camera), the depth-of-field preview button/lever, although not useful through the entire aperture range as mentioned above, is in a comfortable position and does fulfill its purpose at apertures starting from f/4 up. Although built on a metallic frame, the camera's body is mostly plastic. Personally, I don't think it feels cheap (no squeaky noises during handling) but I do feel like exercising caution at all times when handling it or placing it on hard surfaces, and I will think twice before taking the camera out in the rain, mist or extreme cold weather (I wouldn't care with a 35 yrs. old Nikon F1), rolling in the dirt or sand for nature close ups, etc. The camera case, although not made of quality leather as you might expect from a Nikon camera (but again, this is NOT a Nikon built camera), does provide a reasonable level of protection, except maybe for the top edges of the camera, where the attempt to leave the strap hooks come thru, has left those areas exposed to dust and other possible external damaging factors. It is also a bit awkward to remove and put back on because its edges always rub harshly agains the focus ring of the lens, which in time might create marks or even damage, especially on a plastic built lens like the one that comes with the camera. I would suggest looking for an older (much tougher and better built) leather case. The lens that comes with the camera is rated one of Nikon's worst lenses (check out Ken Rockwell's reviews for more info), but that doesn't mean you cannot take any pictures at all with it. A lens choice is always a matter of personal taste, as well as an educated choice for some users. The day I ordered my FM-10, I have also ordered a Nikkor 50mm f/1.2 manual focus lens, a mechanical and optical masterpiece suitable only for fully manual film Nikon SLRs at an unbeatable price compared to similar lenses built for digital or automated cameras. I have removed the bundled lens without even removing the lens cap and replaced it with the 50mm (much heavier as it is all metal built). For those who are not willing to &#34;waste&#34; $6-700 on a new fixed lens, I would suggest the older Nikkor 70-200mm AIS lens. You probably won't be able to find a new one because they don't make them anymore (as opposed to the 50mm above that you can get brand new), but you should be able to find one online in very good condition, anywhere between $100 and $400 depending on the seller. I got one for $220 in mint condition on eBay. Remember, the lens is the most important part of your camera and the decisive factor in the overall quality of your pictures (apart of course from your aesthetic and artistic feel). It remains to be seen how the not-so-high-quality of this camera will hold over time, but unless you want to go for one of the much older, bulkier (but better built) genuine Nikon SLRs, then the FM-10 is a good choice for the money, even if I consider the lens completely useless (that's just me). The reason why I didn't go for an old Nikon is because I couldn't find one from a reliable source. All sellers claim their old Nikons to be in perfect or good condition, most of them actually being completely unaware of any possible problems. Unfortunately, the slightest mechanical issue in an old Nikon SLR is very hard to detect, even harder to fix or re-calibrate, and ultimately renders the camera unusable (i.e. a slight shift in exposure time). With the money I'd pay for a defective Nikon F1 (rated in good condition) and having it fixed, I'd get a new FM-10, a leather case and some lens filters. Overall, even if I don't feel the same confidence (yet) as I used to with my old Zenit 11, I am happy with my new purchase and will try to get the best of it for as long as I can. I hope this helps you make the right choice for you.,
","I was intrigued by the raves for these very inexpensive headphones, and the Koss brand name convinced me to give them a try.I compared them to the Sennheiser HD56 headphones that I normally use for portables, and my AKG 240DF headphones that have been used by many studio engineers in recording albums.The Koss The Plug headphones have excellent dynamic range and sensitivity.  This means that you will get more volume out of weaker amps, such as those found in multipurpose portables, like PDAs and portable synths, like the Yamaha QY series.  They also have excellent bass, which together with the dynamic range, makes them excellent for any sort of modern dance music.Unlike another reviewer, I did not find any problem with the midrange or high end.  I suspect that this perception some people have had, is due to the fact that increasing the bass automatically makes the midrange and highs seem muted - especially in headphones.As others have mentioned, the fit is critical to the sound quality.  Read the instructions found on the inside of the card in the packaging.  Even the orientation of the earphones in your ear can affect the sound.  Experiment a little until you find the best sound.WARNING:  These headphones can go very loud with portables that have decent amps (MP3 and CD players).  Famous musicians like Pete Townsend and Jeff Baxter have hearing problems from hours of loud music - so be careful!,

39,"Before I get started, I'll just say that my review comes from the unit we got at the bookstore to display. The overall product will still be the same, but some things (like the instruction manual) might be different.---------Reading: It's a nice clean picture & the backlit screen isn't too annoying, but I have a feeling that people will be feeling the eyestrain later. If you're looking to buy this for reading at length, you'll need to be aware of this. You can change the brightness of the page, but that doesn't change that ultimately you're still looking at a backlit screen.Downloading: Pretty fast download times, although I only downloaded the free samples from the storefront. (Hilarious since I work at a Books-A-Million & the storefront's B&N.; We're so going to lose money on ebook sales.)Internet: Pretty decent. I pulled up facebook & the page is crisp, clear & loads quickly. I also went onto failblog, a site with quite a few side ads. It was a little on the slow side, but that's to be expected on stuff like this. You can also pull up videos on youtube, so that's a bonus.Battery: Not bad, but obviously won't last as long as the Nook or some of the e-ink units out there. You'll get about 3-4 hours if you leave the wifi on. Not sure about the non-wifi battery life right now, but since the company says it's 8 hours I'd say it's probably about 6-7 hours.Extras: You can change the font, screen background color, & a few other things. While that's nice, I couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed by it. There's also the option to be able to toggle back & forth between the publisher default & your aesthetics of choice. You can also change the background on the main page of the NookColor, which is a nice touch. Since we're not supposed to change that with our store unit, I wasn't able to play with that any.Touch Screen: It's OK. Pretty easy to use, but a few times I found myself really having to wrestle with it to turn pages. Sometimes it would be too sensitive & I'd end up a few pages ahead of where I wanted to be. Not a deal breaker, though. It didn't happen enough to where I'd get overly irritated, but people who are all thumbs with touch screens will be irritated.User Friendly: It's not very intuitive to use. People savvy with e-readers & gadgets will be able to figure it out pretty quickly but people who are new to the scene will be pretty confused with everything. The unit for my store didn't come with any written directions- it was all on the unit. That means that if it's like this on the sale unit then that won't be all that helpful for the people who aren't able to navigate well on the unit.Overall: My opinion is that it's OK, but not exceptionally so. Go for the iPad if you really want something like this. (I know it's more expensive, but if you're willing to pay $300 then paying $500 might not be that much of a difference.) It's basically a Nook/iPad hybrid, but without the option for all of the extras & apps. (Of course if all you want is an e-reader & wouldn't use the iPad's extras, then this is great.) Overall it isn't a bad unit but it just doesn't have anything to really make it stand out. If you're a big fan of the Nook then go for this unit, but I'd play with it in the store first.The only two things that really make this stand out from the other e-readers on the market is that the unit is in color and that the internet on this unit is far better than some of the other options on the e-reader market. While the color option is great for children's books & magazines, this might not be enough for users who predominantly use their readers for plain print reading & that the ones who would want these things might already have it in the various tablets that are on the market.I did enjoy playing with the unit in my store, but I don't know that I would choose it over the regular Nook. Of course this is just my opinion, but again- before making a big purchase like this, view a unit in the store first.3.9/5,
","Update:  Durability is not as expected.  After a few months of moderate daily use (MP3 player in my shirt pocket) during my commute to and from work the connection between the wires and the stereo plug is beginning to fail.  Regular body movements will cause a break in the connection and I don't expect these ear-buds to last to the end of the year.  Too bad since they produce nice sound.----------------------------------------------------Had these for a few months before opening the package and trying them on.  First tried to use the buds as they were packed - without the little spongy covers over the buds - and was totally disappointed with a loose fit, weak midrange, scratchy treble, and almost no bass whatsoever.Finally got the brilliant idea of putting the covers on and giving them one last try ... Wha?!?!  Were these the same phones?  The buds fit much better in my ears and I had a totally different experience with great mids, good treble, and very decent bass.These earbuds won't change your life but they'll make your MUNI commute more pleasant by allowing you to block out the miscellaneous grunts and chirps made by your fellow transit commuters.Just remember to use the sponge thingys.,
","... but great headphones, period, for any application.  These are my favorite headphones - that's not to say they're the most detailed, accurate, or will fool you into thinking they're a set of Stax or anything (they are, of course, astonishingly accurate and detailed).  No other headphones combine this level of comfort, soundstage, openness, and plain excitement into such a compact, durable, and CHEAP package.  These are tiny tiny tiny, but rock out with authority.There's been a lot of jibber jabber on these fair internets about the newest contender for the portable headphone crown - the Sennheiser PX100.  I bought a pair of those Senns and lived with them for a couple of months - they are acceptable for a set of portable cans, I guess, but tend to get very congested and cluttered in the midrange.  They're also bland and cold.  Beyond sound, they're not even as comfortable as the PortaPros, as they require constant adjustment to stay on top of your head while you're walking around.  Finally, the Senns are not only less durable than the PortaPros, but the warranty is only two years vs.  Koss's incredible NO QUESTIONS ASKED LIFETIME WARRANTY.  That's right, you never have to buy a set of headphones again, until you die.  Just incredible.  If you want to demo this sound t a lower price, try out the Koss KSC 75 ear clip model, but be warned they're nowhere near as comfortable.  Buy with confidence.,
"
40,"I'll admit, I bought it to hack it.  If you have no interest in hacking this device, then let me start with the ""stock"" review first.As an eBook reader, it is very good but not great.  eInk and its variants will always be the gold standard by which you measure a reading device, because the utility of such a display in daylight is unrivaled.  My hope is that in time, the Pixel Qi displays make their way into Kindles, Nooks, iPads, etc on such a large scale that this is no longer an issue.  Alas, it remains one, and it is a key criterion for many.  As an LCD touch screen, it is very bright and colors are rich, not saturated.  Touch sensitivity is a little rough, as is accuracy.  I did not see a calibration function.Wireless connectivity is very, very good but for some reason, will not connect with some routers.  The range is impressive, better than my Droid 2.  Speeds are very good, but I neglected a speedtest in this round.Integration with the B&N; store is very tight as expected.  The store app for the Nook is better than the Android app, necessarily: you can browse magazines and newspapers, for one thing.  Display of media is well-formatted and fairly intuitive; I never cracked the user manual or quick start guide (then again, I rarely do that for anything I buy). Prices are competitive with other vendors, and it does handle sideloading of books onto microSD cards.  By the way, 32Gb microSDs are supported.  I run with an 8Gb, and I've filled it mostly with music.And oh by the way, it plays music very well.  Some of you might listen to music while you read, and I am one of those weirdos.  This device, stock, will do just that.  Overall, I like this device, but would probably prefer eInk if I was buying it solely for reading media.However, I bought it for cheap tablet use.  In this regard, it has amazing potential.  Despite the fragmentation of custom ROM and rooting options, you can indeed settle on a Cyanogen ROM and find a lot of functionality on the cheap.  I can browse websites easily if I don't need Flash (currently not working on this ROM); I use PocketCloud to log into my home machines and I can work from there if needed.  I'd love to have Swype on this, or even Graffiti, but it is sufficient to have access to the Android Marketplace and all the attendant apps I have stored in the cloud.  There is no microphone or camera, so those apps have no place here, nor does GPS exist.  However, Bluetooth is available in Cyanogen nightlies so you can now try pairing it with headsets and keyboards.  Thus far, the potential is not fully realized but it perfectly suits my needs today.  With time, this will become a great tablet once Flash is fully operable and the Honeycomb ROMs are fully baked.Stock, 4 stars.  Hacked, 5 stars, tremendous value.-C,
","I remember back in the summer of 2004 I was in the Muskegon, Michigan Best Buy and saw these headphones I bought them after hearing other headphones that were more expensive but went ahead and bought these because they looked durable and I've been satisfied with Sony's bookshelf speakers and figured that their headphones would sound even better. They were the first pair of V600s I've had. I thought the bass and vocals sounded really good but the treble was a little too thin and inaccurate in my opinion. They were still great headphones and I thought I couldn't find anything much better for the price or so it seemed back then. Then a couple of months later I was on vacation in New York  and accidently left these at a hotel and was disappointed that I lost these headphones. I went until January without decent headphones and then bought another pair of Sony V600s in Holland,Michigan but when I opened them at home I was disappointed that they weren't really the same. The cord was too thin compared to my original pair that was heavy duty and thicker. I had them for about 4 years until I got a cat and she chewed the wire right apart.I was pretty ticked off and gave up on this particular model of headphone and decided to save my money for the professional Sony MDR 7506 which I reasearced on different sites that said were  very durable and rugged headphones so I went ahead and bought those. I am a lot happier with the 7506 not just for their durability and thick cord but I also thought and still think they sound twice as good as the V600s (the treble sounds a lot better on the 7506s) for about 20 to 30 $ more and are a better pair.I keep a better eye on my cat and she hasn't even messed with my cords anymore.The V600s are decent headphones but the thin cord makes it so I just can't recommend them to anyone who owns a pet or little kids.,
","Things I like:- Metal band seems durable and is easy to adjust- Sound quality- Affordable price (I'm not an audiophile, don't want to spend $100+ on headphones but I still want headphones of significantly higher quality than earbuds)- LightweightThings I don't like:- Nothing so farI wanted some higher quality headphones for use with my desktop computer; I found many quality headphones at the $100+ price point but wasn't looking for high-end headphones. I just wanted a medium to medium-high quality pair at a decent price that would provide better quality sound than your standard headphones. After reading many reviews and doing a lot of research, I found the portapros and am happy with them. The sound is more rich, bass comes through surprisingly well without sacrificing the high end. They are comfortable to wear for an 1 to 1.5 hours at a time and are very lightweight so you don't always ""notice"" them on your head. I don't carry them around anywhere, but the fold-up mechanism does make these pretty portable if that's what you will use them for. I'm very pleased with these and would purchase them again; they come with a lifetime warranty though, so I may be set for life.I'm sure there higher quality headphones out there that produce much better sound than these; the portapros produce great sound for the average to slightly discerning listner and are priced affordably.

41,"First off, do not expect Nook Color to do wonders.  It is not meant to be tablet or an iPad replacement.  It is foremost an e-Reader with some bells and whistles.If I'm given a choice, I would not buy a Nook.  For the price, I would rather get a Kindle Fire.  I own 4 laptops, 1 iPad 2 for my wife, and 3 Kindle Fires for my kids.  Nook Color is an afterthought and it is for me.  I bought my used Nook Color on another site for $114 (free shipping) 2 weeks ago.  And it was a steal.  The Nook I received was in working order and it looked new.I had no trouble turning it on and everything worked perfectly.  The only gripe was it was extremely slow compare to some of the tablets I own.  Again, I reminded myself that this is not a tablet so I had to be fair.  The features are not too bad but the navigation was confusing at best.Fast forward to today.  B&N; was smart to release an update (1.4.1).  If you already own a Nook Color, you should get the update.  The update improves the speed dramatically.  The navigation still lacks finesse though.Here are some of the goods- I bought it cheap- It has an expansion slot.  I inserted a 16GB micro SD card and Nook recognizes it right away.- The web works fine.  It can now even watch some YouTube.  It also runs Flash.  Nook 1, iPad 0.- The new update allows NetFlix to run.- There are some apps that are extremely useful.  I love the Smithsonian Channel and Pulse.- The magazines look great.  The update also improve the navigation.- The interactive books are great.  My daughter absolutely loves it.And now the bads- I constantly look for free stuff.  Unfortunately, B&N; doesn't offer a lot of free books that are worthwhile.- The apps itself, is sad to say the least.  The offering is a fraction of what you can find in iPad and Amazon.  And most of them are costly too.- While the update improve the speed of web-surfing, it still is slower than iPad and Kindle Fire.- The speaker is terrible.  It is located on the back of the device.  If you hold the Nook on your hand, you may cover the speaker. The best solution is to use a head phone.- The navigation overall needs to be improved. It is a basic Android without much thought.  At times I don't even know whether to double-tap or hold to get more options.Here is my final take.  If you are short on cash, and would like a good e-reader/tablet.  Go get a Kindle.  If you can find a Nook for less than $150. Go for it.I would not spend more than $200 on a Nook (be it a Color/Tablet).  There are much better options out there.Update January 24, 2012I have used my Nook for a month now and all in all, I like it because it allows me to read my magazines and books.  It sure beats a 10 incher tablet.  The update 1.4.1 is definitely a must if you want to use Nook Color to its full potential.  However, I found out yesterday that the update was actually used to close the loop on dual-boot and disable any sideload of apps.  The version 1.4.0 allows the Nook to load Amazon app and the Launcher EX.  Basically it allows other apps other than B&N; to be loaded.  The automatic update 1.4.1 disable this option.  So, if you are dare enough to install other apps, you can backdate the version to 1.4.0 if you want to load other apps.Update February, 2012Nook continues to lose to Kindle Fire in terms of contents.  B&N; could not match to the behemoth of Amazon and I don't think it will ever be.  However, if you are stuck with Nook, there are a few apps that you must have (they are all free).  It helps the Nook Color to be a good companion in a boring world.- NetFlix is a must.  7 inch on your lap and plug in a pair of headphones.  You are good to go.- Smithsonian is interesting.  Want to learn something that you forgot.  This app works great but contents updates are slow.- Dolphin Internet Explorer works great for anyone wants to do quick surfing.  Very fast and very convenient.- Don't know what interest you, try Stumbleupon.  It randomly pulls internet content based on your interest.  Works great on YouTube vidoes.- Good with words, try Nook Crossword.- Who doesn't use Dropbox.  It is a must.- Springpad is great to jot down quick notes.- Pandora works great too, but you need a pair of headphones though.- Who needs newspaper when you have Pulse.,
","I'm not much of an audiophile, and I admit that I initially shuddered at the thought of dropping so much cash on a set of headphones. But then a friend of mine recommended these, said I wouldn't regret it. I'm happy to say that he was right. Watching movies and listening to music became an entirely different experience. Brought out the best in my CDs and DVDs and the worst out of my low-bitrate MP3s. Every little click and hiss became clear as day. Found myself re-encoding a bunch of my old stuff at higher bitrates, but it was worth it. Best of all, they block quite a bit of outside noise. Great for getting some peace and quiet in even the most chaotic of environments.And that's not all. They pack neatly--they fold and fit snugly in the included vinyl pouch, which is surprisingly durable. The headphones themselves have held up pretty well, but then I'm pretty gentle with them. The cord's plenty long and doesn't tangle easily. These little touches make all the difference.If you have more discerning tastes, you may be better served by something else more refined (and likely more expensive). But if you're looking to move up from cheapo $10 headsets, this is as good a place as any to start.,
","Probably not fair to compare these to my last set which were PX100s and cost considerably more, so I won't do that, cause PX100s they're not. That said they are decent enough for the price. I was a bit spectacle on how comfortable they would be since I shave my head and these have no pads, but they fit fine, stay on my head and are comfy enough.They produce decent sound although somewhat muddy and not as crisp as the PX100s for sure. But since they are mainly for the time I spend on the stair master at the gym, the sound quality is more than adequate. They block most of the background noise, but I can still hear a bit of what's going on around me which is not a bad thing.As for portability, they fold up small enough, but not small enough to fit easily in the carry bag that is provided, which is pretty much useless. Without it, it's a pain since I keep them in a pocket of my gym bag and without some sort of small carry bag the cord easily gets tangled. For some reason it wants to maintain the original coiling it had in the packaging. Hopefully over time it will straighten a bit. Not a big deal though and I can make do with some other bag for storing them.How well they hold up is yet to be seen. I'm pretty hard on my headphones and have yet to have a pair last more than two years. They look solid enough but I have my doubts. For the price though, it's not a big deal.Overall I am happy with the purchase and would say the rating on these is about right.,
"
42,"EDIT - Update 1.4.1 (12/21/2011): BIG update rolled out on December 14th, with lots of big changes, most of which really improved the device.First, the ""n"" key, which originally functioned as a home key taking you back to the original home screen, now functions as the menu key instead, like on the new Nook Tablet. Prior, there was a softkey arrow that would bring up the menu function, and Barnes and Noble has moved that function to strictly hardware. I'm torn about whether I like this update, because honestly, I don't like relying just on a hardware key for something like a menu, especially with the issues I've had with Nook parts (I've owned two cords in the past year alone.) It does makes multi-taking easier, when switching from one application to another (say reading to internet), because you don't have to go to the home menu function first. For those of us Nook Color originals, it takes adjusting from old habits, but so far, it's not a bad change.The reader application functions in a much more friendly manner. The page numbers are on the bottom of the pages, instead of the top, in a much less chintzy font, and pulling up the menu tell you how many more pages are left in the chapter. Not really a necessary change, but kind of nice. There are some fonts added, along with FINALLY adding the option to change the tone of the page from white to sepia, night, or off-white. The books also read sideways now, in a two-page fashion, though I'll admit, I don't use that much, and won't, even with the ability to have it on something other than kids books. Just makes the actual reader app a much more rounded and friendly one.The magazine reader had a few changes that are nice. There are animations for the page turns now (though why they don't have that option with the books is a big of an in-congruency), though the animations disappear when you zoom in. The menu at the bottom pulls up the pages in miniature picture form, but are in a much more appealing, accessible manner. Rather Mac-esque, really. Nothing huge, but it makes it all more friendly-looking. Randomly, the magazine reading app is the only one where the ""n"" button is still a home button, and not a menu one. Wondering if they'll notice that and change it in the future.The PDF reader had some AWESOME changes. Before, reading PDF files was incredibly clunky, and did not resolve well on the screen at all. Reading a book involved zooming in and scrolling down, instead of sideways like the ereader application, and when you closed the PDF file, reopening would take you right back to page one, and never saved your last place. Ridiculously cumbersome, and not user-friendly at all. The new update not only saves your place, but it resolves the page so that the text fits better on the screen, and allows the pages to read much more easily sideways. It also scrolls sideways, instead of down, which just makes sense and follows with the overall expectations of the reading experience.Interestingly, enough, they still haven't resolved the issue of PDF files not having a cover when on the home screen or in the menu, even when the information is attached, which is something I was hoping they'd resolve. It's not a huge issue, but it's just a visual annoyance when all the EPUB files have cool graphics show up on the home screen, and PDF files just have grey with the title of the book. Lame.Overall performance of the menu functions and flipping between tasks seems zippier than it was before, and I really appreciate that. The menu functions seem much more efficient and smooth, and that just makes for a much better interaction.The ebook store also changed around, and B&N; completely reordered all the categories and changed the look. I can't say I appreciate all the changes they made, because you can no longer organize things like apps or books based on price, and instead have to search manually in the menu. I'm frugal, I'll admit. I miss the ability to find free apps easily, because let's face it, it just makes me happy.Overall, I love the update they rolled out, though! It's nice to know that B&N; is staying loyal to their original customers and keeping the devices updated.*  *  *EDIT 4/12/2011: Barnes and Noble did an update recently which fixed the glitches with the screen when plugged in, finally. I have not had any issues with the screen lagging or glitching since.*  *  *EDIT 2/28/2011: A new update now allows for Android apps and email on the Nook, which is exciting. I'm not all that into the apps they have, especially the games, but it's a nice touch! It has also fixed the issue of not being able to put your own books on the home screen, and the issue that the Nook was having with recognizing cover art for those books. I can now also put other apps on the home screen, such as the Email or Pandora app, which gives the entire thing a much freer, most customizable feel. Though apparently this update has cancelled out the last one, because the screen glitches when plugged in are back. Oh, well, I'm just happy to now be able to put my own books on my own home screen! Vast improvement right there!*  *  *Original review, from 12/2010:I received my Nook Color as a gift for an early Christmas, and have been using it for a few weeks now, enough time that I decided I can make an educated review.Pros/Cons-It has a great screen, with sharp resolution. Book title colors and wallpapers look sharp and clear, and the touchscreen is responsive. You can adjust the brightness, though I rarely found the need to adjust the brightness even a quarter of what it could be, since otherwise it was a bit too bright on the eyes. That being said, I found that when you plug it in to a power source and try and use it, the touchscreen goes crazy, and won't even perform simple tasks like unlocking the device. You can't flip to the next screen without several swipes, and turning pages can be a haphazard activity. That weird glitch doesn't affect the device at all when it isn't connected to a power source, but it's such a pain when the device is low on battery power and you want to read while it's charging.-The hardware on the Nook Color is nice, with a muted metallic finish on the front and back, which gives it a nice grip, though I immediately bought a cover, so the fact that it's somewhat grippy doesn't matter much any longer. The weight is nice, about the weight of a small hardcover book, which I found rather pleasant when holding. I still don't get the random open-hole thing in the lower left-hand corner, though. It's like you're supposed to use that to clip the device onto something, but I hardly thing someone is going to just clip it onto their keychain for convenience. It's clearly not awful-looking, but I guess it just seems kind of superfluous to me. Oh, well.-The battery life is surprisingly good. I don't have to WiFi on when I'm at home, and the device will go for several days on low-brightness. I actually had it on one charge for about 7 days one time, and was pretty impressed, considering other devices with LCD features tend to eat battery life like some kids eat Cocoa Puffs.-It's Android-based, which is great. However, B&N; doesn't allow any apps from the Android market, which is such a crime, considering that the tablet could be a fantastic tool if B&N; would open up the gates on that one. The fact that it's Android-based isn't really a selling point, it's more of a potential point to keep an eye on, one that hopefully the company will do more with down the road. The tablet does come with certain apps like Pandora and games like Sudoku, which will do in a pinch if you're bored.-It comes WiFi enabled, and it connects to networks easily and without issues. It does recognize B&N; WiFi hot-spots, and remembers them, which means that you don't have to reprogram the networks or worry about not being able to access the in-store features, which is really convenient. The browser is pretty decent, doesn't have flash, but performs very well. I actually used it for emails and checking my Facebook when I was out of town, and it was snappy and quick, though the fact that it doesn't have pinch/pull zooming features (which the picture gallery does, oddly enough) is a bit of a turn-off, because it can make browsing somewhat clunky and inaccurate.-The B&N; store they have on the device is convenient, loads content easily, and is very user-friendly to navigate. Once you have your information in, downloads are quick and easy, and you can also set a password for downloads, to prevent someone downloading books without approval. Also, if you have a gift card for B&N;, you can use it to buy books, but you have to go online to your account first, and save the information on your account before it'll charge it, and it'll always charge to that card first before your credit card, which is a pretty cool feature.-The reader itself is awesome, and you can sideload your EPUB files easily onto the device from your computer and start reading them immediately. You can't, however, read PUB files like you can on a regular Nook, which I found obnoxious, since I have a lot of eBooks in that format (that are from a B&N; affiliated website, no less). You also can't put files that HAVEN'T been downloaded directly from the B&N; store on the device over WiFi onto your home screen, so in order to pull up your own personal files sideloaded onto the device (even ones downloaded directly from B&N; online), you have to go into the Bookshelf menu and go from there. Which means that if you don't have WiFi all the time (as I do), very few of your books will be able to be put on your home screen, which is such a childish thing for B&N; to do, really. It takes away the personalization that the tablet could do so well, and bothered the heck out of me when I first discovered it. Granted, you could probably fix it by rooting the device, but you run the risk of other issues in the software when you do that, so hopefully B&N; will come out with an update to fix that annoyance.-The Nook does read PDF files, but it's a very awkward process, since the screen ratio doesn't fit the allotted size, making the text tiny and incomprehensible, so trying to reads books in that format is a headache; zooming in is awkward and clunky, and takes to long to be worth the effort. Also, closing and reopening the file takes you back to the first page, which, if you're attempting to read an extensive document in several sittings, gets really old really fast. If you have book in PDF form, I would suggest downloading something like Calibre and converting them to EPUB to save yourself the trouble.-Music loads and plays easily, though I honestly haven't used that feature much, since I have an iPod, and if I want a playlist, I go from there. Pictures also load easily, though you have to have it in the gallery/grid feature to see previews, otherwise they are just displayed with file type images until you click on them to open. Silly little issue, but again, something B&N; will hopefully fix in the future.Anyway, great product, but really, more potential than actual greatness at this point. I love the fact that I don't have to leave the house to read a book, which is great since I'm at home with an infant all the time. Is it worth the money? If you buy it directly from B&N; online, it's $249, which isn't an awful price for touchscreen reader (it's really only about $100 more than a regular Nook or Kindle), so I would say that yes, it is. It's just still somewhat disappointing that it feels like it's half-finished, but I'm looking forward to see where it all goes from here.,
","I've sampled nearly the whole Sony headphone line, but the V6 is notable for its flattering sound and good value. While it's unlikely to meet the requirements of a seasoned audiophile, it will delight most everyone else with its ability to render many types of music well.The pads are extremely comfortable. (However, continued use may cause the rubber to flake after several years; Beyer makes fine replacement pads.) As you'd expect from closed headphones, the sound is a little ""closed-in"" -- but detailed enough to do justice to anything from classical to punk. These are fun headphones capable of a nice dynamic range.The V6 doesn't try to emulate the sound of a concert hall or a studio; rather, it offers a pleasant musical experience of its own.-- It's reasonably priced-- They play many types of music-- They're easily driven by iPods or CD players-- The V6 is (aside from the pads) an amazingly sturdy performerIf you're picky...-- The sound is ""colored"" (that is, not completely accurate)-- They have a closed-in sound -- a result of their being closed phonesI've since graduated to the Beyer DT880s, a notably better phone. But the V6 has legions of fans, for obvious reasons. Even people who hate Sony headphones concede the V6's attractive sound. They've served me well for over a decade.,
","I have owned a lot of low to mid range headphones in my lifetime. Currently, I have a pair of skullcandy earbuds, a pair of the stock iPod earbuds and a pair of $35 Sony Studio headphones (the big over-the-ear ones).They were not working for me. The sound on the Sony ones were pretty decent, but prolonged use made my ears ache and could get very warm in the wrong climate (like...summer). They were also very heavy, so reading text books or just reading my Kindle, these things would not cut it as it would also put strain on my neck. My ears were just not made for earbuds, as I had various problems with those. The iPod earbuds failed miserably, as the sound was always too shallow for me and they kept falling out of my ears.So, I looked for the most rated headphones (not earbuds) with over a 4 star rating on Amazon and stumbled across these. Over a 1000 reviews and it still had 4 1/2 stars? Yeah, I'll take some time to check these out lol.So I got them a week ago. To avoid any ""premature"" reviewing, I let them sit the first three days with music on constantly, racking up about 36-40 hours of ""break in"" time before I tried them out objectively.First the headphones themselves. They are very, very light. The head band are a couple of thin metal bands with plastic pieces that adjust size. I like this because metal is durable but it's also light and airy and doesn't make me feel like I'm wearing a music factory on my head.The ear pads are more comfortable than I imagined. They are not dollar store ear pads (although they look that way) and are comfortable on the ears.A wildly awesome thing about these phones that people often overlook are all the parts that make them comfortable. The ear pieces themselves are hinged, so they bend depending on the shape of your ear. The metal bands are firm but flexible so it doesn't press too hard on the head or ears. Then there's comfortzone settings. It took a minute to figure out how the settings work, but once I did I was treated to a unique comfort experience. Comfortzone consists of two pads on either side that rest on the temples. The firmer the settings, the more pressure on your temples and less on your ears. I found this awesome as I could sit with these headphones on my head for 8 straight hours and feel no ear fatigue at all.Now for the part everyone wants to read: the sound. I am NOT an audiophile and I won't use any technical terms. The music sounded just plain great. I can hear bass lines in rock songs, hip-hop and rap songs thump (but not uncomfortably so). The music sounds whole and complete and not shallow and airy like iPod headphones do. The high notes sound good and even at high volumes don't cackle or distort and in no song that I listened to did anything sound muddy or wrong. The volume is well balanced. Maxed out is too loud and that's something my other pairs of headphones can't say. I've often had to max out settings just to get a decent volume on my Sony headphones. These I can keep in the middle volume range and it still sounds good.They're not noise cancelling and they leak sound. I'm okay with this because when I jog, I'd like to hear the cars coming before they hit me ;) so if you're looking for noise cancelling and quiet for others, then you should probably keep searching.All in all, for the price, I can't imagine having gotten a better pair of headphones. Personally, I love the retro style of the headphones. Keep in mind that Chucks have fallen in and out of style for 90 years and they're top sellers. This has been in and out of style for nearly 30 years and it's a top seller. I put them in the same category (and, as it happens, own both now) which is ""totally awesome"". If you're looking for some lightweight phones that sound great and have a unique look, then your search is over. I wish I'd found these 15 years ago when I started using headphones for the first time.,
"
43,"I should preface this by saying I also own a nook (non color 3g) and an iPad 3gI order a LOT from amazon so when it came down to getting an e-reader it was a tough choice to pick B&N; over amazon.Why did I do this?I still LOVE the value of a retail store, living down the street from a B&N; i go there often to shop and pick up little gifts as well as browse books. There have been plenty of books that by their cover (yes i judge) and short summary I would've bought but because of my ability to skim the book in store I have decided not to buy.Similarly there are some great books out there but for photography and coffee table type books, you really can't experience them the same way with a nook or an ipad. All that being said, I decided to support B&N; because their library is just as large as amazons and I throughly enjoy their storefronts.Ok onto the review.Reading on the nook color is easy, the Android interface is fast and reliable, not to mention easy rootable!Reading on the nook vs the nook color is vastly different because of the eink display on the nook. There is a fair amount of eyestrain associated with reading on a backlit display but I had no problems reading for well over 2 hours on it. The font was just as clear and easy to read as on my ipad.Size wise it is not much different than the original nook but is much heavier.It is lighter and easier to carry than the ipad because of its dimensions.In the end I did not buy this product to read on it, I bought it to root and use android honeycomb on it.This makes the this the best value out of any reader on the market in my opinion.The nook has virtually the same specs as the Samsung galaxy tab aside from the 3g.at $250 (buy directly from B&N;) you cannot complain, Honeycomb runs smooth and opens up an entire world of possibilitiesfor this little tablet.,
","I originally bought these headphones to go with our digital piano, but my wife didn't see any need for them, so they became my computer headphones. Darn :DI want to start out by pointing out that these headphones have a very soft feel on the head, yet are firm enough to not fall off. Sound quality is extremely important to me, not just blasting bass or highs or anything. These have excellent fidelity. You can hear the highs, the lows, and the mids very clearly on this set, and one is not overpowered by the others. One thing I have noticed about lower-end headphones is the fact that when you have too many things going on in music (or games, or movies) some parts start to literally get lost as the headphones simply cannot handle that many streams simultaneously. These headphones do not have that problem. After reading the reviews from people who have enjoyed theirs for ten to twenty years, I look forward to a long relationship with these.I listen to a wide variety of music, and everything from Linkin Park to Mozart sounds great on these headphones, as well as a wide variety of PC games ranging from thrillers where hearing clearly is essential to survival, to FPS games with explosions and gunshots. I have noticed with these phones, I feel like I have my 5.1 system on, and have to take them off to ensure I am not being obnoxious to my neighbors, only to learn that it is simply the quality of the headphones that I am hearing. The same thing happened with our digital piano, I thought I was hearing the piano outside of my headphones as well as inside them, but that was not the case. Anyone who is disappointed by these either has ridiculous expectations, or they do not know what sound quality is.Update 2/15/2013So, I wanted to get on here and make another comment on the comfort and noise reduction. I have put them on when I sat down at my computer, only to realize an hour later I was still wearing them, and not listening to any music. They are comfortable enough to forget that they are on, and the are noise cancelling enough that they literally cut the noise levels in the room in half. I continue to love them.,
","**Update 9/8/10** These headphones are great but they do have one potentially serious design flaw.  The stereo connector is very flimsy.  Despite being very careful, mine broke in under a year.  The stereo connector literally just pulled apart as I was removing it from the ipod one day.  The wires pulled right out of the connector.  After checking the web, I see I am not the only one to experience this.  Someone was even kind enough to post a picture of it above, in the product photos.  I still think they're great headphones and I ordered a new  pair (although I plan to have these replaced under warranty and keep as a spare).  I knocked off one star simply because now I have to shell out $6 plus shipping to replace this set (although I opted to pay $30 for a new pair to save time).  However, if the second pair breaks as quickly as the first, prepare to watch the review stars plummet.  What good is something if it won't last at least a year?*** End of update ****I've tried pretty much all types of headphones. I was looking for a good solid pair, under $50, preferably over-the-ear but not too big (for gym, athletic use and better portability).  I stumbled across these on the web and saw that people loved them, so I came to Amazon to read some reviews.  Seeing that they were highly rated here as well, I ordered a pair.  These headphones have a solid reputation for a reason, they sound great.  The minute I plugged them in, I knew why they were so highly rated.  Clear highs, deep lows.  I mean, it's not bone rattling bass, but it's decent enough if you don't want to lug around a pair of $50+ self-powered heavy headphones.  Easily the best sounding headphones I've bought the past year.  And that's in a group of Skull Candy, Sony, Apple, self powered, noise canceling... I've tried it all the past year.  The only (extremely minor) gripe I have is that I agree with others that it does feel flimsy at times.  I like that the moving pieces are metal instead of plastic (can't tell you how many plastic headphones I've inadvertently broken from simply putting on and removing), but it still has a somewhat delicate feel to it.  They do come with a lifetime warranty, which is pretty sweet, (although a further check of the terms reveal you pay to ship them back and have to include a $6 check.  Something potential purchasers should be aware of).  I'm happy with my set and agree with everyone else that these headphones come in a portable package but possess full-sized sound.,
"
44,"I had the original Nook, had a friend's Kindle for a couple weeks, and now have the Nook Color. Although it's a bit weird to be writing a review of it on Amazon, I felt that potential Kindle purchasers should understand their options.The Nook Color is, by far, the best eReader I've used (including the iPad). It's not perfect, but it almost is. The LCD screen is very easy to read, which surprised me since I was a big fan of e-ink and did not like long-term reading on the iPad. The lack of need for a night light is great, and the software it ships with is lightning fast and almost bug-free. Really, there is no lag when I'm using it and the functionality (once you spend 3 minutes learning it) is near-perfect.BN is quickly catching up to Amazon on content...frankly don't notice a difference anymore. Plus, you can side-load eBooks from Google and elsewhere.I know this...I will never go back to e-ink again and love this screen.I also LOVE the delivery of magazines on this thing. Really, it's better than the real magazine. You get full color reproduction of text and pics, and it gives you an Article View if you just want to read the article. It is a great way to get magazines and will be better as they get more publishers (right now, it's a decent list but it could be better).I also really like the multimedia support...I can load photos and pics on an Micro SD card and take my music with me. If I'm in a wifi area, I get full Pandora support! I wish it had 3G, but this is still great.Having said that, the Color is not perfect. First off, the weight, while acceptable, is SLIGHTLY too much. It won't cause strain like the iPad and is perfectly capable of being read in bed (you can lock out the gyro so the book doesn't flip Portrait=>Landscape), but it's not the unnoticeable weight of the Nook or Kindle (or paperback). Still way better than a hardcover though.Second, the screen, while great, is slightly tactile, not glass like you would be used to on an iPhone or high-end Android phone...this is nitpicky, but I noticed it.Third, no Flash support yet (and, while it is a great web-browser, it's not a laptop, iPad, or even like my HTC Evo). This, and the lack of pinch-zoom multi-touch, affects my enjoyment of the web brower (note: you can zoom, just not pinch-zoom). UPDATE: Pinch Zoom is here! It's very good, but not great, implementation. Makes the browser that much better!Fourth, the newspaper delivery, while acceptable and similar to the original Nook/Kindle, is not good enough. Frankly, it's easier to read the web pages of the papers than on this and pales in comparison to the magazine delivery, which really is SUPERB!Finally, and most importantly, is the battery. This is not like an e0ink reader. To give you an idea, the other day, I started out with a full charge and I read around 600 pages of a book and did some light browsing. I did not use music or Pandora and did not pay any games. At the end of the day, I had to charge it again. This was about 7 or 8 hours of use. That's OK with me but it ain't the type of thing that you can go on a three day road trip without your chord like the Kindle or original Nook.Anyway, it looks like my cons are longer than the pros, but really, this is a great product. I can't wait to see Amazon's response and appreciate the (hopefully) friendly competition that this represents!,
","I ordered my Sony MDR-v6 on November 24, 2012 sold by Amazon and received them Monday December 3, 2012 with free super shipping.The reason for my purchase of this is because of the large amount of positive reviews.my initial reaction to this headphone was ""Ouch"" because it has a higher response to treble than my last headphoneand what it has excess in for treble, it lacks in bass. I really expected more bass, I can even crank up the lowerband of my EQ and it still hasn't got enough kick to my liking.but after a few days of listening, my ears adapted.Many people believe there is a headphone ""burn in"" but I believe this to be personal hearing adapting to the sound.the sound is okay, it's nothing mind-blowing, my Sentry 880CD headphone (which cost far less) sound just as good as this (if not better)the reason I say ""If not better"" is because the Sony MDR-V6 has a quiet, but noticeable hissing sound at all times,even when there is no music playing, my Sentry do not exhibit this quality.in fact, I would rather have purchased Sentry 880CD again instead of this, my expectations were too high due to the over-exaggerated reviews of others.The Sony do have better isolation than the Sentry, but I am not worried if others hear my music.the clamping force is not as tight as desired or expected, many of the reviews claim it's too tight. This was another factor in why I made my purchase,I wanted tight headphones because the tighter they are, the better they sound. This headphone slopes down and the band rests uncomfortably on the top of my head.all-in-all I am not completely disappointed in this purchase, the Sony MDR-V6 headphone does sound good, but it is not as other exaggerated reviews would have you believe.,
","I have been looking for a set of headphones that I could use with my iPod Touch. I have tried MANY earbud type sets as they are the best for portabilty. I could not find a pair that could give me a wide spectrum of sound at a decent price. I do have a pair of Ultimate Ears MetroFi 150v that came pretty close to what I was looking for (they were a steal at $16.00 shipped from Dell). However, I needed a pair of headphones that were comfortable for extended periods and most of all sounded great. Well, after reading the reviews here I figured I would give these a try. I was shocked when I cranked up my iPod Touch with some Metallica and could hear ALL of the music without distortion. The Koss Porta-pros are very ""airy"" and do not cut off the world around you yet they produce a very clear and natural sound that is hard to find in any other headset under $75+. I am very picky about sound since I used to do sound engineering for a 8 piece band and got used to hearing a live, wide range of sound with detail that is very percise. The bass response with the Porta-Pros is natural and clean, the mids are natural and full and the treble is also clear and true. I am very pleased with these headphones and honestly the lifetime warranty sealed the deal. I remember when I was a kid in the early 70s. My father bought me a Koss headphone set (I cannot remember the model), but listening to the current top 40 music of the day from my simple record player, I remember how good those headphones sounded back then and how it would transport me into another world. Looks like I just got back to my musical listening roots.,
"
45,"Bought mine a few days ago and returned. It is an ok device but does not truly shine as an ereader and I will expand on it shortly.1st, this is more a hybrid device than an ereader. An ereader basically is for reading documents in an electronic format. Examples of good ereaders: Kindle (of course), Nook 1st generation and Sony. Nook Color, besides allowing you to read, let you browse internet, listen music, play some games and much more tablet oriented stuff. Of course, there is nothing wrong on that until you start thinking about how important color and internet are for just reading a simple book.So, what's cool or nice:-Internet.Full color internet experience, with nice virtual keyboard and ok browser. Touching the screen and keyboard is like an iPad or similar tablets, but is comfortable enough for short emails or using Wikipedia or Google.-PDF supportWith Nook Color not only you can read PDFs in a nice full color screen but you can expand or zoom in at will, move along pages with a simple touch or even rotate and read in landspace mode. This feature is really amazing and the selling point if reading PDFs is your only or most important task.-Full color screenPretty obvious. If you like magazines or would like to get electronic subscriptions of any of them, look no further. The resolution, colors and screen is perfect, a real pleasure to read using a NC. Depending of the magazine you can also extract or read the text or article portion only, leaving images apart.BUT!... not everything is perfect ...-No landscape mode for booksYou have landscape mode while reading PDFs but not while reading regular ePub books. This was a real surprise to me, a bad one! Landscape mode allows you to rotate and read poetry or technical books without cutting the paragraph or breaking lines. With no Landscape mode you are forced to read every book ""as is"" and for a hybrid table which costs more than $200.00, in my opinion, it is not acceptable. My Kindle 3 rotates and it's 50% cheaper!-LCD screenI must admit this device has less glare issues than iPad or Galaxy, but if you have read using eink technology you would not go back and change to LCD again. Reading on a Nook Color for several hours is not easy for your eyes. And forget about using it at your pool or outdoors, unless is cloudy or you find the perfect angle; the glare will bother you while reading anyway. Indoor is a different story but it created some eye strain on me anyway, specially after long reading sessions.-HeavyFor serious readers (those who read novels, fiction books, technical books) or more than 2 or 3 weeks per month, please think again before buying. With about 18oz your hands and wrist will start complaining soon and if you don't have a desk or something to put your NC on, your choices are using your tummy, chest, lap or knee as additional support. A deal breaker. Being a Kindle 3 owner I know what I'm talking about. You can hold a Kindle 3 with one hand and read for hours with little or no problems at all.-BatteryOnly 8 hrs of continue use, average. I bought it a Tuesday, read for about 5 hrs that day, went to bed (leave it on but in sleeping mode). Next day morning turned it on, used it 1 more hour and soon after that the device was at 16% of battery life. (I barely used internet and brightness was at minimum) Another important point about battery and charge is that the Nook Color must be charged via wall, not USB or computer unless screen is off, which means you must forget about using the device during the charging process. The adapter is also proprietary so you can't use your Nook 1st gen adapter or the one some Androids use, I don't like that, I don't like proprietary stuff. The more standard, the more common, the better to replace or find.-No zoom or ability to enlarge imagesAn image with wrapping text around in that cool book? If you can't read it or maybe is too small, then sorry...you're out of luck. You have (at the moment of this review) no way to click, expand or enlarge that image. If you read mostly novels this means nothing to you. But if you read technical books with some images or illustrations on it, the size will be so small that is basically useless and not readable at all. I can't believe this simple feature is absent and I can only hope for a future fix via firmware-Android based but not full access to Android marketShame on you B&N.; This device could be a real hit if was not so closed or locked. As usual, this device will be hacked for those with brave hearts or basic computer skills (actually, it has been) but warranty will not be honored and it's a hassle to keep it up to date after official B&N; firmware upgrades, in case you hacked or rooted the device; also you won't be able to read books in-store if you root it. While B&N; keeps selling the unit without Android Market or a restricted version of it, this device will be like having a Magnum revolver in your hands without any bullets. So much power with Android/Linux but you just can't use it.-No ""read me"" featureFor a $200.00 tablet, I would expect this feature. The Kindle it's not so powerful in terms of hardware or processor and it reads the English books for you.SummaryIf you read a lot, portability and battery life are important for you, forget about Nook Color. If you are a casual reader, looking for a fun device and distractions (Internet, Games, etc) Nook color will fit your bill. Just keep in mind that Nook Color is not a true ereader though, but more like a tablet with reading abilities; if you are aware of that and eye strain is not a concern, this can be a great buy.For now, I will pass. My Kindle 3 is simpler and lighter and does very good what it suppose to do: let me read (or read for me) my favorite books. Most novels and technical books are not in color so I don't need a tablet with Internet access to enjoy them, why bother then?,
","I did very well this past Christmas season.  I added theSennheiser HD-555and Sony MDR-V6 to my collection of headphones.  I intended to keep both because I was going to use them differently.  I got the Sennheiser HD-555 mainly for movies and the MDR-V6 for music.  Unfortunately, I had to send one of them back.PROS:- High quality build- Folds compactly- Fairly comfortable- Out of this world frequency range- Nice bass- Love the coiled cord- Includes carry pouchCONS:- Highs were harsh for meFirst off, I burned in both sets of headphones for about 2 straight days.  I then spent about 4 hours comparing both headphones with a variety of sources.  My intention wasn't to eliminate one but just to compare them since they were both nice headphones.Right away I noticed that the bass response on the MDR-V6 was much better.  Listening to rap, techno, trance, and synthpop was much more fun on the MDR-V6 than on the HD-555.  After a couple of hours, I started to notice I was turning the volume down on the MDR-V6 because it was causing discomfort.  However, I realized that it wasn't the volume, but that the highs in some of the music I was listening to were just harsh.  Too harsh.  The MDR-V6 is more than likely reproducing the highs accurately, but the trade-off is that some music was just too fatiguing to listen to.  Red Hot Chili Peppers just killed me!  If I hadn't been comparing them to the HD-555 I may not have noticed it.  I think I am in the minority of users who have an intolerance to those higher frequencies.  I was disappointed to have to send them back.  By the way, my source material were Lame VBR encoded MP3's, some FLAC encoded music files, and DVD movies.On the flip side, I felt that the actual physical comfort of the headband and ear cups were quite reasonable.  The pressure was not nearly as intense as theSennheiser HD-280 Pro.  The coiled cord, compact folding, carry pouch, and durability were all things I found to be very positive.I am not saying that the Sony MDR-V6 will be harsh for everyone.  I believe I actually have a heightened sensitivity to higher frequencies for some reason so it might just be me.  But if you get them and feel your ear drums ache, you may be experiencing the same issue I did.  A vast majority of users who have purchased them seem to have great success with them.  In fact, I recommend everyone at least try them.  They are an amazing deal on Amazon for legendary cans.,
","Just unboxed these today and started listening to them, and my first impression is that they're quite possibly the simplest and most functional I've ever used. No frills, no sexy designs, no gimmicks, no extra features, just GREAT sound and a fantastic, functional design that has withstood the test of time. I read the reviews that others gave and I thought ""they can't be THAT good,"" but for the price, I didn't have much to lose.Pros-Adjustable earpieces work surprisingly well; basically, it just gives you the ability to change how much pressure the headphones put on your ears. I find that my ears get sore with most headphones, but these are very comfortable.-The adjustable headband will fit any head size. I haven't got my hair caught in it yet.-They fold up for greater portability, and come with a very stylish leather bag (probably fake leather, not sure).-The sound is fantastic, better than anything in this price range. Clear mids and highs, and decent bass that doesn't sound distorted when I crank it.Cons-No manual/directions. They weren't that hard to figure out, but a simple sheet of paper with directions would have been nice. It took me a couple minutes to find out that you need to extend the headband, then clip together the earpieces, then retract the headband to make them small enough to fit in the bag.-I'm sure the foam earpiece covers will wear out, but luckily they sell cheap replacements.-The leather bag is quite small, and the headphones barely fit inside.Overall, great headphones. They do what they do, and nothing more. Perfect.**UPDATE, ONE YEAR LATER**: I accidentally pulled the cord out of my headphones. I shipped them to Koss and they sent me back a brand new pair for free (but I had to pay $9 for return shipping). No nonsense or forms to fill out, just a new pair of headphones in about a week. Koss, you've gained a lifelong customer.,
"
46,"Last year my husband asked me if I wanted a Kindle, because I love to read all the time and I try to be eco-friendly when possible.  I was intrigued, but my biggest weakness is magazines and I didn't like the availability or look of them on the Kindle.  When the iPad came out, I was blown away by the beauty of it, but felt like for a few dollars more I could just get a whole new laptop and it would be almost the same size.  For travel, the iPad seemed to big and fragile for me; I need to be able to jam all my toys into my backpack and not worry about them.When I stumbled onto the Nook Color, I absolutely flipped my wig and couldn't wait to get one!  Full color magazines, that look just like they do on the newsstand!  This could single-handedly save the rain forests - I seriously buy a LOT of magazines.  I also save them forever because you never know when you might want that one article or photo again, which drives my husband crazy.  So perhaps the Nook Color can save my marriage as well!  That's a lot of expectation to put on this adorable little device, but I think it's up to the challenge.Santa decided to come early to our house, so I just started playing with the NC a few days ago, and it is my first e-reader.  It was almost fully charged right out of the box, so I was able to start playing with it in less than an hour (it says you can use it while it is plugged in, but they keypad is VERY oversensitive when plugged in so I don't recommend it).  It easily connected to my home wifi and linked to the Barnes & Noble account I had set up earlier that day.  If you don't have home wifi, you might have to visit a public wifi location in order to activate it.  I recommend setting up a B&N; account beforehand if you intend to purchase anything from there, as it makes the first-time Nook use very smooth and enjoyable.BOOKS: There are many many books available from a variety of online sources, check the product details for formats (please note it does NOT support Kindle format).  I understand it's also easy to download books from your local public library, though I haven't tried that yet.  The B&N; Shop function within the Nook itself is the easiest interface but certainly not the only option.  While reading, it's very easy to adjust the font, screen brightness, and more to make it as comfortable as possible on the eyes.  At night I turn the brightness all the way down and find it very comfortable for my eyes while reading in bed.  I've read for hours on end without any sort of headache.  I haven't used the highlight, look-up, or share functions very much yet, but they're super easy to incorporate if you enjoy that sort of thing.  Page turning is an intuitive flip of the finger, or you can tap the side of the screen to move forward or back.CHILDREN'S BOOKS: The color on these looks amazing, and the ""read to me"" feature is wonderful for little ones learning to read on their own.  I imagine this would be great fun for a kid stuck in the back seat of a car for a long trip too!  There aren't a ton of Read to Me books available yet but they are adding more every week.  I don't even have kids but these are pretty awesome.MAGAZINES: Obviously this was a major feature for me!  The appearance of the magazines is absolutely gorgeous, the text and photos are clear and sharp.  You can use the ""finger pinch"" method on the touchscreen to zoom in and out, or you can use the ""Article View"" feature to pull out just the text of each page at a pleasant reading size.  The magazine includes every single page that you'd find on the newsstand, including advertisements, which to me is a benefit because I sometimes enjoy the photography and trends those provide.  Magazines can be read in portrait or landscape format, and you can flip through thumbnails at the bottom of the page to reach a particular article.  Most of the currently available magazines offer a single-issue purchase or a 14-day free trial, then bill you monthly for as long as you want to receive issues.  Subscriptions are very easy to manage so canceling is not complicated.  So far there are about 80 magazines available, and the number seems to be increasing regularly.NEWSPAPERS and PDF's: I haven't tried these yet, though some have reported formatting that make certain ones difficult to read.  The ones purchased directly through the Nook store are more likely to be formatted appropriately for the device and easier to read.  Better PDF support is likely to come in a future firmware update, though a lot of it depends on how the original publisher sets up the file.INTERNET: You do need a wifi connection to go online; 3G is unlikely to be available for the Nook Color unless you also purchase an accompanying data plan.  So far most web pages look crisp and beautiful, but are not as fully functional as on a laptop or computer.  Flash functionality is not available yet (but is planned) and a lot of people are experiencing difficulty with email and other text box typing.  I believe this will be fixed very soon, but for now the web is more of a ""read-only"" experience.MUSIC: You can load your own music or use the included Pandora app to link to your Pandora account.  The speaker isn't great so headphones would come in handy.  I'm extremely in love with my new iPod Nano so I will probably strap that on while reading rather than use this feature.VIDEO: Our first try produced some choppy playback, but I think the processor was very busy setting up the hardware because we had just gotten it out of the box.  After that, it played everything perfectly with jaw-dropping video quality!  It will play videos in MP4 format, so get yourself a converter and a microSD card and load it up for your next trip!  Apparently videos can also be side-loaded through the mini-USB cord.  I've only tried it on the card; it reads directly from the card with no problems.OTHER: You can add your own photos to use as background, or just to show friends.  It comes pre-loaded with a few games (sudoku, crossword, and chess) which work well and are fun.  ""Lend Me"" is an exclusive feature that allows you to swap books with other Nook users, and you can find groups of folks online who will swap with you if none of your friends have a Nook.  It uses the android operating system, and an app store is scheduled to open sometime in early 2011 so there will be much much more available in the coming months.I'm the type of person who doesn't need my phone to be a camera, my iPod to be a dvd player, or my e-reader to be a laptop.  The Nook Color does a WONDERFUL job as an e-reader of not only books, but also magazines and newspapers, and it has some other fun bells and whistles.  It does what it's supposed to do very well and the additional features make it a great value for the price.  I would give it a million stars if I could!,
","I love radios and have owned over thirty. I am constantly looking for the holy grail - a radio with great reception and plenty of features. I haven't found that yet but I can do comparisons. Here are the pros and cons of this one:Pros:1) This is truly a pocket radio and very light. It feels lighter than a deck of cards.2) Digital tuning - a rarity in pocket radios. You can quickly scan from station to station and from AM to FM to TV.3) Has a speaker built in. You don't need headphones. The sound quality is adequate for talk radio and AM music. The volume is adequate for quiet environments.4) It has TV audio and the reception was ok on the four major stations in my area.Cons:1) There is no built in FM telescoping antenna. You need to insert headphones or the included wire and switch it to speaker in order to get most FM stations. A small telescoping antenna would have been an improvement. I find the hanging wire annoying and I think it is just a matter of time before I lose the wire.2) The reception is not as great as the Amazon review suggests. I found that there was a good deal of static on several AM stations and AM is very dirctional. FM was great on headphones, though.3) The cary case is a joke. It looks like an afterthought. It is a membrane thin piece of vinyl that will not protect the radio.4) The ear buds are also a joke.5) Weather reception was the worst I have ever heard on a modern radio.6) The tuning light is bright and, no doubt, draining the batteries like crazy.If you are looking for a pocket radio that is digital and has a built in speaker, this will do. I see lots of room for improvement, though. I also think it is overpriced. I think it should be 39.99. It would be about right at that price.,
","I have been having Grado Labs SR60 and SR80 for a couple of years, but Koss Portapro always rings into my mind as they are much cheaper, and they are supposed to be really good with a sound signature somewhat similar to my Grados.Okay, I finally pulled trigger two weeks ago. My initial impressions are (only burned in for about 10 hours).- Bass is a little too much (that's expected and is a selling point for Portapros). But with EQing, I can make it a bit better to my taste.- Sound is not too clear overall (comparing with Grados of course), but this may improve over time with more burned in (based on my prior experiences).My sources are very decent MP3 players and laptop with external sound card. No external amps were used in any way.In the end, Portapro lives within my expectations. I like them for their compact shape, portability (which Grado lacks), comfort (slightly worse than Grados). I think these are not as good as Grado Labs SR60 and SR80, if a straight comparison has to be made. Value wise, I would go to SR60 if you can buy used. If you only buy new electronics, then these are really good values.,

47,"I should preface this review by stating that I'm predisposed to liking tech gadgets that are a bit geeky, but do appreciate good industrial and UI design.The NC is really a great color eReader that also happens to have the makings of a terrific, Android based tablet.  BN literally buries the Android OS under a very thick custom UI and turns off many Android features.  This thick customized layer is what make the NC a great eReader, but a not so great a tablet. So while it is locked down, it does what its meant to do very well.One CAN get to non-BN eBooks in either the ePub or Adobe PDF format. Either format works, looks, and reads very well, easily as good as the best the market has to offer in terms of an eBook reading app.  The fact that BN chooses to bury the location of the downloaded non-BN content AND prevents one from creating shortcuts to either the book file or folder, placing said free books on the book shelf, or even listing them in your list of books is an annoyance to the tolerant and tech savvy.  To non-techies and those less tolerant of mucking about with a gadget, e.g., Grandma, it'd be a showstopper.  But then again, would such a user even KNOW how to get to free eBooks?Movies, again well-hidden in the file system, look great, but BN has capped the max resolution below the abilities of the screen AND the stock player is finicky about format.  For instance, my ripped for iPod Touch movies play fine.  My ripped for Droid Incredible movies aren't playable.  This despite both are MV4 files with AAC soundtracks.  The latter are higher resolution and bit rate so that's the issue.  Again, annoying, but not a real problem.The web browser is just fine.  Pretty much a stock Android browser so fast enough, compatible enough messing around, but if I were going to really do some research, I'd use my computer.With Android 2.2 coming in January, and a BN 'approved' Android market, it'll be an amazingly capable tablet for the money.And that is what one has to remember, it's an exceptional value given the hardware (fast processor/GPU combination, GREAT IPS LCD screen with better color/resolution then an iPad), 512MB RAM, expandable storage, great build quality), and has the best eReader app bar none.  Once Android 2.2 is added with some access to at least a few other apps like email, better browser, and a more format flexible music/video player the value will be simply unassailable...at the price.Pros:Great screen - overall looks, color quality, text quality, adjustabilityeReader UIMagazine format is excellentNewspaper and magazine subscriptions are month to monthBuild qualityIndustrial design - it actually sit flat on a table unlike the iWobleMicroSD supportForm factor - fits MANY of the now discontinued or about to be discontinued Amazon Kindle 2 cases!Battery life (for such a lightweight LCD based device in its size range)Full Android experience just a hack awayUnderlying processor/GPU/RAM is quite powerful though not tops, but more then capable of moving to Android 2.2 and possibly even GingerbreadCan read library eBooks if your local library carries themCons:THICK BN UI if you really want the tablet partsUI takes a few minutes to learnBluetooth not enabled (though it may be Bluetooth ready)No microphone (and therefore no Skype down the road unless the headphone jack can be used like early generation iPod Touches)Will need to hack if the BN Nook Market does not have what you want in terms of appsBN prices their books too highBN magazine subscriptions can be high, though some are a good valueNo camerasRecommended to the magazine/newspaper reader especially.  Best of the LCD eReaders, period. Great value in an Android Tablet.,
","This is a nice, compact 5-port plug-and-play switch that definitely improved the speed of my local PC network.  I read a review where this switch runs hot.  I have all five ports in use and its running around 99F degrees.  My DSL modem with just two ports in use actually runs hotter (101F).  Okay, four degrees but you can tell a difference when you touch them.  The FS105 switch does not interfere with AM radio reception as my old Linksys 5 port hub especially at the upper AM radio band.  Perhaps it is the metal box of the FS105 that provides better shielding.  Its nice that Netgear gives me the screws and wall anchors for mounting the switch to something either wood or plaster.  But is it too much to ask Netgear to include a mounting template (piece of paper) so I can put those screws exactly where I need them with less fuss than measuring and guessing?Perhaps I should not be disappointed that the FS105 I got is not the same one as pictured on the Amazon page.  That picture shows an uplink button and the unit is wider.  I connected a cable from my DSL modem/router's uplink port to the first port of this switch and it works just fine.If you only need four to five ports, this is a very nice non-managed switch.  And did you know that according to Netgear, the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) is twice that of either the FS108 (8-port version) or the FS116 (16-port version).  It may make more sense to buy two of these switches from a reliability sense.,
","For the price, these sound great and are comfortable.  I can wear them for hours without problems.  The bass is surprisingly decent for those few songs that need it.  I like the open ear design for use at work as I can hear when people are talking to me.  The whole package is much smaller than it seems in the pictures with the ear pads just barely covering my ears.My biggest complaint is with the portability, or rather the compromises made for that portability.  They fold up decently small and very easily.  This ease means that all adjustments that you make are immediately reset when you take the headphones off your head, even for a second.  Since I use these at work, I just keep them at my desk and don't need them to fold up.  I'd rather that they didn't so I could adjust them exactly how I want and never have to bother again.EDIT October 2013: I've had these since July 2011 and they still sound great, but I have run into a few issues.-They tend to unfold in my bag if I take them with me.  Not a big deal, but it tends to tangle the cord when that happens.-The plastic pieces that hold the two halves of the metal headband together started to unsnap and fall apart.  It was annoying to keep putting them back together, but some superglue has fixed the problem.-After 1.5 years, the cushions have fallen apart.  They're pretty thin to begin with, so no real surprise, and replacements are under $5 for three pairs, but kind annoying.Still, I'd buy another pair if I had to.  Maybe a non-portable version.,

48,"First off, for those of you buying this product expecting the e-ink experience, you are wrong.  This isn't an e-ink screen, if that is what you are looking for, go with (a) the original nook, (b) the kindle, or (c) any of the other e-ink dedicated e-readers on the market.This iteration of the nook is marketed towards certain select categories of readers:-The Magazine reader-Students with text books that have graphics-Childrens' books with lots of pictures-Comic book readersIf you notice, these are categories of readers that benefit from the ability of the reader to handle color graphics, which is something e-ink can't yet do!PRICEFor the price, you are getting an android tablet with limited functionality, though, with some technical knowledge, it is possible to unlock this device to be able to fully take advantage of the android market (though it may void your warranty, so do it at your own risk).  Similarly sized android tablets go for prices starting at double the price of the nook color, but they come with full functionality.  Another device this has been compared to is the iPad- which runs at about twice the price as well for the very base model.  On the price point, you are definitely getting a decent deal, though, you are sacrificing some of the functionality for the the reduced cost.Also note, you are not getting 3G access or any other cellular service to access the market- unlike the original nook, that came with the free mobile access to be able to make purchases from the nook market on the go.  The likely reason for the lack of mobile access is due to the fact that this device runs a lot faster and features a full web browser- this increases the speed and easy of the user to access web content- which would be undesirable to any phone service that hosts access because it would reduce the service that their paying customers get.  Instead of mobile data service, users have the option of accessing the BN market and the full internet through wireless.  With today's cell phone technology, many phones are able to be set up as wireless hotspots that users can use to get access on the go- when they are away from their home network.  Overall, this isn't a big deal to me, but I am sure some original nook users depend on that free mobile service to get access to the BN market, so this would be a draw back for you for sure.WEIGHTHonestly, this device does run a little on the heavy side, however, I do believe that it is slightly lighter than it's predecessor.  Still, for the e-reader market, it is heavy.  For the tablet market, it is a little more reasonable.  The weight is a sacrifice, but as long as you aren't trying to read while laying on your back, you should be ok.USER FRIENDLINESS AND EXTRA FEATURESI find this device to be quite simple almost immediately.  Every function that I have looked for has been where I expect it to be and everything has worked smoothly for me.  The page controls while you read work great, and I love that they now give you the option to tap to turn the page rather than having to swipe like you did with the last version of the nook.The full web is pretty easy to use once you get used to typing on a touch screen keyboard (which is always annoying).This device also integrates with your facebook, twitter, and google accounts.  This is great for the avid readers that want to be plugged into their social media.Another feature that is nice to have on the reader is Pandora- it is a nice added bonus to have internet radio available on the reader.One thing I wish this device had was access to android market, but I guess you can't have everything.OVERALLI like this tablet.  I think it was a good buy and I would buy another one if this one broke.  For the price, you are getting an underpowered tablet, but it still has access to the full internet- which you can use multiple windows in.  It is primarily a reader, which makes me wish it were as easy on the eyes as e-ink, but for the market it is being geared towards, you can't really complain about that!,
","I bought this to supplement my internet connections for my home theater system. I have my office with modem and router upstairs, and powerline networking for downstairs. Lots of people dump on powerline, but I have NO problem with it. I used this connection for my PS3, because I personally hate wi-fi, especially for gaming. I recently upgraded my TV and theater system to internet connectible equipment. My options were to buy a new powerline adapter for the multiple new connections, use an old router I had laying around as a switch, or buy something like this. I am glad I went this route.The unit is very solid, and heavier than you would expect just looking at it, but that doesn't matter, because you wont be holding it. It really is as trouble free to install as everyone says. I have ZERO loss of speed in PS3. I can even can still stream Vudu in HDX with full strength. This unit is attached to a Belkin Conserve power strip, and comes on like a charm everytime power is restored. If it helps those with a similar setup, here's what I got:Sony Bravia 46"" TV ethernet connected, Sony Blu-Ray home theater system ethernet connected, and PS3 ethernet connected to this switch. Everything is connected to Belkin Conserve Smart F7C007q AV Energy Saving Power Strip (TV master)with Netgear powerline adapter providing the internet connection from my upstairs Netgear router.And finally: Yes, it is only 10/100, but find me one thing in your home, starting with your modem and signal from your ISP that needs more. If you aren't a business or have a super home network based on 1000, you really don't need it. This will be fine for 99% of everyone, and perfect for home theater uses.,
","I have had these for several years and they have been subjected to steady use. I'm writing this review far, far in arrears.The sound quality is good. It's not a legitimate hi-fi listening experience but for general purposes they are good. The bass is not spectacular. It's present, but it's not what I'd call deep and rich. The treble is also good but not especially crisp. The sound quality is adequate. If you're accustomed to listening to hi-fi headphones, or a decent home system with a powered 10- or 12-inch sub, this doesn't hold up.I've had these for several years. They have been used for casual listening on the laptop, gaming, and to cover my ears while I'm mowing the lawn. So - a lot of sweat, a lot of wear and tear. They are pretty comfortable. This year the covering of the ear pads started to flake apart and peel off. There's a padded cloth beneath the plastic which is actually a lot more comfortable than the loose plastic cover, but it's going to get gross in a hurry if I keep using it for yard work / lawn mowing.Overall these are OK. OK sound, good durability. They are all plastic and pretty light, but hey, proof is in the pudding. These have lasted for years of heavy use. The drivers are still good. I've broken other pairs of headphones with no special abuse involved so this is pretty good durability. I can't say with certainty whether there are other offerings in the same price range with better durability or performance. Obviously, it would take years to do to another pair of headphones what I did to these, but overall, I'd say these are good. Not stellar. Not stellar sound. Not stellar durability. Pretty comfortable... maybe best-possible in that category. But they're not superior to a high-end pair of Sennheiser or Bose or Audio Technica headphones. They're just... good. If you want good, reliable headphones, good sound, good durability, for $40 or so, this is a good fit for you. If you expect lifelong durability or stellar, top-end audio quality and wonderful bass, this really won't do it for you.,

49,"Well, for the price, it's easily the best Android tablet out there if you don't care about not having 3G, GPS, and camera. Took less than 5 minutes to root it once I did all the reading on nookdevsdotcom wiki. Installed Launcher Pro, Google Maps, few widgets, Angry Birds, and Opera browser.The device has great style and build quality and battery seems to last pretty good in my 10 hours of play time with it. Screen is gorgeous. I think if they skipped hard metal and went for carbon metal or good plastic it probably would have shed few ounces in weight and would have felt lighter to hold for long time. That is no deal breaker though as the 7"" size is perfect to hold for long time unlike other tablets that are way too big to hold with single hand for reading.Tried couple of kids books for my daughter and the color screen makes the content look rich and attractive. Will soon be trying out periodicals and photography books. But my main intention of owning it is for tablet and I would recommend it. I read instructions on how to make NookColor connect to Adhoc WiFi Hotspot. Once I get that working, I can Tether the NookColor with my rooted Xperia X10 to browse while I have no WiFi networks around.I wish I have some cons to mention but that would be silly at it's price point. It's a real steal at it's $249 price.,
","I loved this product right from the beginning, just from seeing how it combined the program listings from my cable and DirecTV providers into on guide, and would automatically switch between inputs depending on what channel I selected. Seems logical, but no one had ever done it  before!The 2020 is the way to go at the moment, because you'll find this  so addictive that any less storage space will not be enough. I find that  the Standard recording quality (which yields 20 hours of recording) works  fine for me at the moment with both my DSS and cable programming,  considering it's better than I was getting with VHS. I suppose that if you  get hooked on the better quality, it would probably be hard to go back.I  was disappointed that the 2020 does *not* come with Firewire ports as  advertised here on Amazon.com, as a box with future programming  improvements *and* expansion possibilities was really exciting. Once the  copy protection issues are worked out, I'd love to be able to add another  20 hours to the unit with an external drive, but maybe Replay will  facilitate that somehow.Anyhow, the bottom line is: This unit is in many  ways the home entertainment appliance I've been looking for for many years.  It's smart, it's convenient, and it can only get better as features are  improved and small bugs are removed. When was the last time you were able  to upgrade the firmware of your VCR?,
","I bought this unit from amazon over ayear ago and the reason was I felt the price was good and with al the tapes I make I wanted some control over the sound quality.  The unit is okay but has some klitches.  Currently I am running my MD player/recorder and my dual cassett deck through this unit to my receiver.  It allows me to do this because it will acommodate two tape decks as well, I might add, tv or audio visual.  These are important features if you are using last years model receiver with no MD input. You can really impact ont eh bass midrange and the high notes with this unit it has the goods what is difficault is that the buttons stick and as a consequence you have to manipulate them to make sure they are all the way in or all the way out.  Before I figured this out I thouhgt the unit was broke and put it in the garbage.  I couldn't just pitch and it is a good thing because when I got an MD recorder and realized I needed a way to attach it to my stereo I started playing around with the unit and discovered the stiky button problem.  Now I am just recording away and am pleased.  Like anything in this life there are ups and down points.  If you have some patience and want great bass or more difined midrange or aweet highs even playing with annoying buttons makes this unit worth the price,

50,"High Points:-Very Responsive Touch Screen-Touch screen is easy on the eyes even though it's back lit-Page Turning (very fast, instant, and seamless - no flashing or delay - my favorite feature)-Very organized menu-Decent sound quality-Physical home screen button (very useful)-Free eBook Fridays curtesy of Barnes & Noble-eLend technology from your local library (if they offer this service, mine does, it's a very nice feature to have, only reason why I chose a Nook over a Kindle)-The kids books are fun to read on this-The internet browsing experience is quite nice. Web pages load quickly-The interface and device are both very beautiful-Great accessories available for item-Great Size - fits easily in my hand-Back Lit display is very very nice to have - no need for a flashlight - can read in the dark)-Very easy to book mark pages-Playing games on this are a lot more fun than playing games on the original Nook (thanks to the touchscreen)-Barnes & Noble eBook store is quite nice and easy to browse-The on-screen keyboard is also niceLower Points:-BATTERY LIFE (if I used the internet at all, I'm lucky if it lasts through the day on a full charge - with the internet off, it still only last about 3 days if you use it everyday - the standby battery life (with the device in sleep mode-not off) is pretty good though.-No physical page turning button - sometimes I advance or flip backwards by accident-Weight (not a deal breaker, you get used to it, but it could be a lot lighter)Conclusion:I love love Love my NookColor. I take it with me everywhere I go. There's no 3g option that I'm aware of, but I only browse the internet with I'm at home anyway. The battery doesn't last long enough for you be connected to the internet too often anyway. There is no cool page turning animation like on an ipad, it just changes instantly to the next page, which is still a great feature on this item. It's not so great as a tablet though. The internet browser is great, but there is no flash support (not for the ipad either though) and there are few apps. That is not important to me as I'm using this as an eReader and occasionally play the included games on it when I'm bored (sodoku, crossword, chess). I like that you can play music and listen to it in the background. When connected to the internet, the Pandora Radio app is nice to have in the background, though I've found it rather difficult to turn off when I'm done with it.I highly recommend this to anyone who wants an eReader and doesn't care if they have to charge it back up every few days.,
","I am an early adopter of Tivo and it has completely changed the way that I watch TV.  I'm glad that people are finally catching on to what I've been saying for over a year which is:  TIVO IS THE COOLEST THING EVER.  The main thing that I hear from people when I try to explain the benefits of owning a Tivo is &quot;But I have a VCR - why would I want this?&quot;  I have put together a brief list of the benefits of owning a Tivo for you non-believers.1. I, too, own a VCR.  And with all the good intentions in the world of taping programs that I wanted to see - I NEVER DID.2. Aren't you sick of missing your favorite TV shows?  With Tivo you will never miss your favorite shows again - in addition, my little Tivo friend may help you find new favorite shows.3. Don't you hate commercials as much as the next guy?  With Tivo, you will never be forced to sit through another minute of those crappy commercials.  You will not even know what people are talking about as they discuss the new Bud commercial...you'll merely shake your head and know that those poor, unfortunate souls don't have a Tivo at home.4.  Don't you ever have to go to the bathroom in the middle of watching something?  I won't elaborate on that one - but wouldn't it be nice to pause your TV to jump up and answer the phone, grab a snack, etc... without having to worry about what you're going to miss.5.  You'll rent less movies.  Which also means that you'll save more money.  Forget renting.  Just pay for the premium channels that you were always to cheap to pay for before because you figured that you'd never watch that many movies.  Now you can watch them all.So, to sum up my little Tivo review - I have to say that you will completely streamline the way you watch TV when you get a Tivo.  Stop torturing yourself with the network's schedule that doesn't fit your schedule and make up your own.  With Tivo there is always something good on...what YOU want to watch.,
","This product does not work. I purchased this product to replace a Faulting ADC 215 Equalizer. This was the only choice on the market. After getting the unit I was able to connect it quite simple in to my system. I have a DBX unit for my Reel To Reel and had to connect it directly to the Reel To Reel, not much of a problem. But then the problem started to unfold. First the buttons, They are confusing, and don't work half the time. Then I noticed that I could not monitor tape recording output from Three head Deck and DBX record monitoring. With the EQ connected to a deck that monitors it seem to short the input to the output, causing the input level control not to respond, not distortion but not good for you tape deck. After that I started tested a different configurations. I have a 2 Head deck, So I connected it to the EQ 200 and it worked okay, but still had problems with the buttons happened again. I then connected the Reel to Reel without DBX, direct bypass the monitor loop and it worked okay for the first few times, then all of a sudden I could not record on the Reel To Reel, the input controls didnot work and the signal to the meters were pegged, not good, then I losted the 2 head deck. Powered off everything and tried again. After several reset everything worked again. So I decided to give this unit one more try, by adding one piece at a time and testing one piece one piece at a time. I added the Three Head Deck (Teac V711), to Tape1, then tested, worked okay for a while and then things started not working. Remember this is just 1 TAPE DECK !!!!!! connected. Powered off all components and things went back to working. I said okay maybe it is me let me read the manual more closely. Figured out the button (Tape 1>2/Tape2&lt;1) button depends on the setting of the (Audio/Video) button and also the (Line/Tape) button so to listen to Tape Deck 1 you must have Tape1>2 + Audio/Video + Line/Tape LED Green. Okay that worked, only for about and hour and then same problem happen, input controls stop working and meter pegged and again this is just 1 TAPE DECK CONNECTED !!!!!.What I have found out after opening the unit and putting it on a Oscilloscope, I found that the contacts in the switches are very poorly made and are solider to close together and are causing electrical interference. When a button is depressed and testing the contacts on the Oscilloscope showed a little ambient noise -75dbm level, which is okay, but as you use the switch the noise level increases until it shorts, that is why when you power off and let the unit sit and power back on it works okay that is kind of a electrical discharge so to speak and the ambient noise is back to around -70 ~ -75dbm. The open circuit test fluctuated from inf to 10K ohm resistance. Closed circuit test revealed from 0 ~ 1 ohm resistance on average but fluctuated to inf at times. That why the sound cuts out and the input shorts to the output.So all in all the unit went back for a refund. Please don't buy this unit. It is low quality and poor craftsmanship that it will not last more than a month or so. It does not support tape monitoring, and don't try to connect a Three Head Deck it will short out your Deck. The buttons don't work and short constantly. Tape to Tape dubbing is limited to only monitoring source, THAT IS CORRECT, when dubbing you can only list to the source Tape and not the dubbing tape to insure that the deck is recording okay. This is a very poor design!!!,

51,"Technology changes and grows with each passing second, so sometime in the future, something else will eventually dethrone the NookColor (just 'tis the way of things...I was a Blackberry fangirl, and converted to Android when it finally stepped up to the plate...but Blackberry was 'the best' for me until Droid).Anyway...with that said as justification for my 'current' qualifier in the title....for me in the current available items on the market, it's NookColor all they way, baybee.The screen is fantastic, both indoors and out, and it's readability is profound.  I don't like it's failure to be as responsive whilst plugged in and charging, but when not plugged in, I've yet to have a problem with it.I love how it's divided into different options, and that it supports PDF as well as the ePUB format.  There are books galore out there in this manner.  I also love that I can share this particular unit with my 7 year old daughter who is just starting chapter books, but still has a love for picture books.  We have several Tomie DePaola books on there already for her!As an Android fan, I'd of course love to see it connect to the Android Market...but I didn't buy this to be a bigger version of my Android. I bought it to be an eReader.  With the add'l memory space avaialble, and the fact that the battery CAN be replaced, just those two features alone for me raise the Nook or NookColor head and shoulders above the Kindle.That said...while I had a slight preference for the Nook itself over the Kindle, I'm even more thrilled I waited until the NookColor came out.  I'm looking forward to a long future snuggled up with my new best friend. ;),
","The Palm V is the second Palm Product that I have owned.  (After purchasing a Palm Pro and experiencing numerous problems, I upgraded to the V, hoping to salvage my large database of entered addresses.)  And, for the second time, I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the Palm Products.  BOTH Palm devices displayed the same problems, specifically:  (1) after a few months of ownership, the screen response begins to fail, requiring almost daily recalibrations of the Digitizer;  (2) many attempted recalibrations of the digitizer simply fail, because the screen become SO far out of alignment, that the user can NOT enter necessary menu selections to even request a digitization;  (3) attempted Full Device Resets become impossible, since repeated Full Resets begin to no longer properly reset the device; (4) as the screen begins to fail, the ability to enter keystrokes in the Graffiti language begins to decrease, forcing a user to rely on the screen's slow and tiny &quot;QWERTY&quot; keyboard; and (5) the Operating system still lacks simple security, such as permitting a user to set the device to automatically power off with a password lock (if a user wants a security shut-down, a user has to step through several screen strokes in order to EXPLICITLY shut the device off with a password...no automated lock is available on power down).,
","I read another review on here complaining about the ""sticky buttons"" on the Audio Source EQ 200. After reading another review saying their unit worked fine with no button problems, I decided to take a chance, hoping that the other reviewer's button problem was an isolated incident. Wishful thinking. I've had the EQ 200 for about a week and the same problem showed up on mine. I was listening to an old album on my turntable when one of the stereo channels just cut out. At first I thought it might be a loose cable, or worse, a problem with the cartridge on my turntable. Then I remembered the review about the ""sticky buttons."" Sure enough, I went to the EQ and jiggled the buttons, and the sound cut in and out as I did so. After jiggling them a few times the problem went away for a while, then it out of nowhere started acting up again. It's not so much that they ""stick,"" as it is that they just plain don't work properly. The have a ""cheap"" feel to them; all the switches appear to be mounted to a single flimsy bracket. When you press one switch you can see the adjacent ones move. Besides the fact they don't work, they are confusing and limited the way they are formatted. They don't let you monitor the tape deck's output when recording; something that should be a standard feature of an EQ. The buttons on my old Radio Shack/Optimus EQ made a lot more sense in how they operated for dubbing/monitoring. There are a couple other annoyances on the Audio Source, too. The analyzer display has no sensitivity adjustment; when I play my CD player, the display is just maxed out. You can adjust the display by turning down the input level knobs, but I only want to turn down the display, NOT the volume! The ""0"" line on the EQ should be a different color for easily identifying the relative position of the sliders, but it is simply white like all the lines, which makes it difficult to easily identify the center line. If I were keeping the unit, I would take care of this problem with a magic marker. There are also no scale markings on the input level control knobs, leaving you to guess as to when you have the left and right balanced. The sound quality seems decent when it works, but what good is a stereo component if the sound cuts out while you're listening to your music? The illuminated sliders and spectrum analyzer look neat, but hey, I don't buy a stereo component just for looks. Seeing as other people have complained of the same button issue, I'm sure Audio Source has to be aware of the problem. Obviously, they are not going to invest the resources to correct the problem on something as obsolete as a graphic equalizer. It's too bad, since this model seems to be pretty much the only EQ left on the market for a home stereo. The only other EQ I found other than professional models for rack-mount systems, was a TEAC model which doesn't have as many inputs as the Audio Source. I am returning the Audio Source for a full refund; no sense having them send me another one when undoubtedly it will have the same defect. I guess I will try my luck with the TEAC, either that or put up with the muddy sound my stereo has without an EQ. I will just have to do the old cable swapping routine if I want to do any dubbing with the TEAC.,

52,"I got mine from B&N; and I'm very happy with it! My color ebooks look so great on it. The only problem I have is with playing youtube videos. I'm using the link B&N; put on my bookmarks.Other than that though, its awesome. It works really well & haven't had any trouble with any ebooks....however some image scanned pdf books need to be flicked up/down instead of sideways like regular books.UPDATE:After playing with it a little longer, I got things going better. My youtube videos all work fine and I love it even more now.I have actually purchased a few different ereaders before this since I was trying to find one I liked (such as Sony Touch, kindle and a few others which are all newest models) and my NookColor is my absolute favorite!A few problems that I hope may be fixed with future updates is when I visit certain pages (ex: google.com) & tap a text box to type something in, my keyboard will dissappear & I have to tap text box a few times to get it to reappear.The other thing is my sound seems very low when turned up all the way.In any case, I still LOVE it. The color is AMAZING & I can use this for hours! No eye strain trouble here & it is able to read EVERY ebook I load onto it. I haven't had to buy any B&N; books yet because I already owned so many,
","I've not seen a cheaper price, and I've been looking in stores.  This is a good value.Keep in mind, though, unlike the cheaper versions of this card, this card does NOT come with a flash reader.  I was disappointed to find this out, but it was my own fault for just assuming it did.  I still give it 5 stars.[A note to HP Jornada 548 customers.  This card works fine with the Jornada Pocket PC.  I say this because it is not mentioned in the advertisement that the 128MB version is compatible, but it is.]One nice thing about this card is that there is 24/7 tech support available if something should go wrong with it (or with installation or whatever), but I don't know what could really go wrong with it --I guess that's why they offer the tech support!Anyone using MP3s should REALLY go for this card and skip the 64 MB card.  The 64 MB card would be rather skimpy, and with 128 MB you'll ALWAYS find things to store on it.  (I've had my card three days now and I've filled up 50 MB already, downloading songs, books, and maps).One nice thing about having a flash card for a PocketPC (or other handheld) is that you can back up your entire regular memory onto your flashcard easily, without having to worry about memory failure.  That is pretty neat, kind of like a second hard drive for your computer...,
","Initially, when I bought my Creative Labs Webcam 3, the button was stuck. But after replacing it, I have had no physical problems since.This package includes a manual, the webcam, webcam software and some image  editing software. I never used the Image software so cannot say much about  it. The Webcam software is excellent, it includes the regular Video and  Image capture software but also has a motion detector program. This allows  you to capture images any time someone or anything passes the camera, great  for detecting if people are using the computer when your out.The quality  of the camera is great. 640 x 480 video capture is quite jerky, at about 12  fps average but at 320 x 480, the image is quite smooth sometimes exceeding  30 fps. The focus is a little dial on the lens, easy to adjust (Autofocus  would be nice though)This camera works well on Netmeetings and Cuseeme,  I have had no problems since. By the way, installing was quite easy, all  the programs installed from the installer, I had absolutely no  problems.All in all, this is a very decent package. I only once had to  talk to tech support and their service was prompt and helpful.,

53,"REVIEW....Part 2:Loved my Nook Color before the new software updates and app additions...but now!!  WOW!! I own a Motorola Xoom Tablet and have only had it for about a month.  If these updates had come a month earlier I may never have purchased the Xoom, but with that said, and now that I have both, their are differences that I'm glad to own both.Nook Color for the value:emailgamesadobe flash (you tube and much more)musicreading (books and magazines with brilliant color) prefer the Nook for reading bookssurfing the internetsize (easy to hold)and for women it fits in my handbagVersus...Motorola Xoom:emailgamesadobe flash (you tube and much more)sharper picture when viewing movies/videosmusicreading (from kindle and nook downloads to the Xoom with their apps)surfing the internetsize (being larger for a better viewing experience) it won't fit in my handbag (but that's mine)quality is amazingmuch more....There are many many things similar to the Nook versus Xoom or Ipad but the value of the Nook Color over the others isthe best and for your average user who just wants to surf the net, view videos, read your email, listen to music andplay (at the moment limited games) and to read books (size for holding to read is perfect) the Nook Color is the BEST valueand it won't disappoint.1st review:Received my NookColor for Christmas and waited until now to write my review.  I wanted to make sure what I write will help others.  Take this device for what it is....a e-reader and not a tablet.  I love it for reading ebooks and emagazines.  A perfect size for books and just a little too small for magazines but if you have patience you can make any page larger just by pinching your fingers open.The color of photos are amazing and beautiful.  I can view just about any website, but not videos from flash.  Again this is not a tablet. But I can view many Youtube videos.  I have downloaded my own photos and they look great.I cannot open my emails from my carrier (comcast), not sure why. The website...but not the individual emails from my contacts.The touchscreen is pretty sensitive and sometimes I end up having to do things twice.I gave my review four stars only...because of my email restrictions and the sensitivity of the touchscreen.Overall I do love the size and the many things you can do with the NookColor.FYI...I typed this review on my NookColor...,
","I wanted a GPS primarily for driving and finding addresses.  The Garmin EMAP deluxe does exactly for that purpose, and does it extremely well!First of all, if you want to find specific addresses, you need to get the metroguide CD and download detail map info into your GPS.  Otherwise, all you get is major roadways and highways.  You won't get lost, but if the house you're looking for is located on some local road, you won't find it.  You need a data cartridge to hold the detail maps.  The emap deluxe comes with an 8 mb cartridge.  8 MB is sufficient, although I think it should've come with 16 MB....  You also need a PC interface cable, which also comes with emap deluxe.8 MB will hold detail maps for approximately a radius of 25-30 miles.  If you're driving across states, bring a laptop and the cd.The screen is sufficiently large so that you won't have to scroll painfully.  The display is clear, and the backlighting is very nice in that you don't lose any contrast.  You can look at the thing in pitch blackness and you'll see the map extremely well.This gadget is extremely fun to watch, and very satisfying-- i.e. you won't be disappointed in terms of what it can do-- whether those functionalities are worth (the price), that's a different question.  If you drive a lot and get lost a lot, or if you wish you can find shortcuts if you're stuck in traffic, it's definitely worth it.  Also keep in mind that the metroguide CDs cost (extra).,
","I bought these earbuds for my CD player (at the time) because the ones I had before died on the right side. They were a pair of RCA behind the neck headphones I bought at Family Dollar for very cheap. I would buy another pair but now I have an iPod and want to buy mostly earbuds and clip headphones that are more portable. I was planning on buying a pair of Philips earbuds at Target because (I thought) these were dead on the right side and I dislike the iPod earbuds, but when I plugged these into my iPod they worked fine. After a break-in session they sound even better.Well, they are only ten bucks, so what can you expect? Not a ton, not a surround soundstage and great, powerful sound, but maybe something that has at least average sound, are comfortable, and will last a decent amount of time. And thatt's mostly what I got with these earbuds.They don't have stellar sound (that for some reason a ton of reviews rave about), but they have decent sound that's good enough for the money. Not a lot of bass, but some pairs at this price have barely any bass. The mids on this pair are emphazised (but not by a lot, props to Sony). And they do have a good, clean sound to them, so even if you are unhappy with the low end of these earbuds you at least have a good upper end.For other aspects of the earbuds, they are very comfortable and fit much better than the Apple earbuds, but feel better with the pads. I have already lost the pads but still fit fine and are still comfortable for long periods of time. Also, these are some durable headphones so far, and after a half-year of use they still put up nicely.Overall, not a bad pair of esrbuds for portables. Already got a better pair? Keep these for some useful back-ups. They don't have amazing sound, but are comfortable and last long enough to make them worth the price. 4 stars.NOTE: This is a waterproof version of the MDRE828LP earbuds. These would be a better deal if you are using them mostly outdoors.,

54,"I bought the Nook color after using the original Nook wifi to read a few books.  I'm sure like many people I was drawn to the ""color"" of the screen.  It is crystal clear, it's great for books with drawings or art in them.  Really brings it to life.  This is about all I've really liked.What I don't like is its heavy.  Compared to the original Nook and the Kindle it's a heavy monster.  The screen glares with everything.  I hate seeing myself in the screen when I'm trying to read.  The touchablilty of the screen is 100 times better than the b/w Nook.  It doesn't turn when you turn the Nook itself, even though you have the screen adjustment feature turned on.  Did I mention it was heavy?  Also I took it outside and yes I adjusted the brightness all the way up.  However, I could not read the screen with my sunglasses on even at its brightest setting.  It's like my Iphone, can't see the screen in sunlight.  This is the part that frustrated me the most.  Also the lighted background of the reading screen seemed to make my eyes excessively tired after long periods of reading.  The battery life is pretty short too.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this ereader.  Get the Kindle, you'll be much happier and it's cheaper.  Also Kindle books don't charge tax to buy them like Nookbooks.,
","I started using Logitech trackballs several years ago and have never been disappointed with them - in fact, I find it hard to use computers that have traditional mice! Recently, my TrackMan Marble gave out, and I replaced it with the TrackMan Marble Wheel. I found it to be a quality product as well.Having used a TrackMan before, my thumb already was conditioned for use, but I still had to adjust the mouse settings in the Control Panel to make sure I could reach all parts of the screen. I have a little difficulty because I'm missing some muscles in my right hand, but I can still use the TrackMan well.  I also appreciated the customizable buttons - the wheel doubles as a third button, which I use as a double-click button. There are many other options available, including the ability to switch the click and right-click buttons if you wish. I was disappointed to see that Logitech didn't make this a four-button mouse; I would have liked to see the three original buttons (from the TrackMan Marble design) remain and have the wheel/button be a fourth button. Also, I found the wheel to be a bit more difficult to use as a button - I tend to scroll as I click from time to time, which causes me to open things I didn't want to open.The wheel is very valuable - I found that I missed it immediately when I went to a computer without one. The wheel makes scrolling much easier in applications, and you can set the scroll amount from the Control Panel as well, although you may have to find a compromise because you can't set the amount separately for separate applications.The quality is excellent. You certainly won't have to clean it as often as traditional mice, although it still needs to be cleaned periodically (or more often, if you're into Diablo-type games). Cleaning is easy - just insert the tip of a pen into the little dot on the mouse, and with a turn, the retaining ring pops out and the ball can be cleaned.You can use this in a USB port or as a PS/2 mouse; however, if you plug it into a USB port, understand that you may have difficulties if you have several USB devices or if you have an intensive device like a Zip drive connected. I've rarely experienced problems, but on occasion, if my Zip drive struggles, it locks up the mouse as well. This is more of a USB issue than a Logitech issue, though, as you can tell from reading the Iomega Zip reviews! Just keep it in mind.I've never felt bad after buying a Logitech mouse, and this was no exception. The only suggestion I'd make to Logitech is to design a left-handed TrackMan Marble. I like to divide my home and work usage equally, especially when a Diablo II or Icewind Dale is released, and you can't get one of these for a lefty. Other than that, I give it high marks and would definitely recommend it.,
","These Sony headphones are a great option for the price range. The ear cups are very comfortable, even when wearing for long time periods, and they provide a decent sound in a variety of uses. These were bought for my boyfriend to practice on his electric drum kit, and he says it works well for that. I've used them in-flight to watch movies on my laptop and enjoyed their performance then, as well.Other reviewers have noted problems with the inline volume control, but I have yet to have an issue with that and have owned these since 2009, I believe. I enjoy the extra long length as this makes it easy to stand up and stretch or move around a bit during a movie (or the boyfriend's practice session), and not worry about getting your head jerked from the cord being too short.There is a moderate amount of noise cancelling with these headphones, but don't expect anything excellent in that department. With heavy music going you'll know someone is speaking to you, but will not know from which direction or what the person is saying.I do feel that the audio quality is poorer than you'd get with a much higher priced headphone setup, but for this price and intended use, I cannot find any reason to not give these 5 stars.,

55,"I bought a refurbished Nook Color a few months ago as well as a dual-boot android Micro-SD card (from eBay).  This is by far the best value tablet I've found anywhere!  NC is well made, arrived in like-new condition, reliable, responsive and by booting to full Android (with the dual-boot micro-SD) it is a real tablet with full access to the Android market. Only cons are lack of microphone or camera, but for a total cost of &lt;$180 it's awesome!  Good battery life, beautiful screen, responsive and a really excellent reader (especially in low light - but the screen can be made very bright for daytime use).  I also have a Kindle keyboard which I love for daytime reading but the NC works in the evenings in a darkened room and does all the other things a tablet can do.  Just NC on a holiday trip and left my laptop behind!  NC was perfect for email, RSS, games and reading, including pdf books and Netflix movies.  If you have an Android phone, using this is the same with a much better screen.  It's a really good tablet as is, but with the dual-boot MSD card it is an awesome deal!,
","Our IT vendor ordered this for  me 3 years ago (yes, the camera has been out that long... makes you think, doesn't it) when I told him I didn't know anything, but I needed a digital camera in a hurry.Having been new to the world of digital cameras at the time, I was easily impressed when I opened the package. They advertise the camera as being Mac compatible via a serial port.Well, Macs haven't shipped with serial ports for YEARS. Why not USB?!I had to buy a [price] adapter by Belkin (about the only one in existance that would connect this camera to my G3 at the time). The images download SLOOOOOOOW via a serial port. USB is a much faster architecture. Of course, firewire is 100 times faster than USB, but since Windows hasn't caught up to the technical advances of Mac yet, USB would have been sufficient for a cross-platform market.When you're using Olympus's proprietary software to download the images from your camera, you can't do anything else... it does not function in the background. Very sloppy programming... no need for such a simple process to take up so much of the system heap.The camera uses 4 (four) AA batteries, which add to the weight of the camera significantly. If you use the LED screen in the back of the camera, prepare to carry an additional 12 AA batteries with you for a day-long shoot, because you're going to be changing batteries at least 3 times in order to shoot a single day on a vacation... this camera eats batteries for breakfast.This also  applies if you use the flash. There is very little warning that the batteries are low... when there is almost no juice left, a pitiful battery icon will flash briefly in the view finder and then that's it.  This camera does not use rechargable batteries....About 8 months after owning this camera, I started noticing a delay in response time. I'd click on the shutter release and a full second and a half would pass before the picture would be taken. This is too much of a delay! The picture should take immediately... just like it does on a 1955 Brownie Hawkeye. If I'm trying to shoot an action shot or an animal or a child, every split second matters... when I click, the picture should be taken immediately, not a week later. Fresh batteries don't make a difference in the delay.The camera does take some half-way decent 640x480 JPEG shots, but the camera is slow in writing them to disk, which means you can't take the photos quickly in succession.  You also can't delete a bad shot on the camera, so even if a shot is awful, you're stuck with it until you load the disk into the computer to delete the shot... which means you have to wait for the ENTIRE roll of shots to load into the program and download in order to even delete them.There are some great bargains to be had in the computer world.... This is not the case with digital cameras. You truly get what you pay for. After being exposed to some very nice digital still cameras and digital camcorders, I can confidently say that this little Olympus is one of the worst I've ever used, and should definitely be a last choice for anyone using a Macintosh.,
","I'm going to start with the GOOD: The sound is OK.  Highs and mids are decent while bass lacks a bit.  Construction is really durable, I like how there's no exposed cable other than where it runs to the player.  If you fall asleep with headphones on like the Panasonic RP-HTX7-W1 that have an exposed cable above the earcup you'll likely form a break in the cable from sleeping on it.  Not so with these cans.  Also the cable is nice, thick, and it's coiled.The BAD:  It's almost impossible to listen at an enjoyable volume and be polite.  Even at just 50% volume on my Zune people across the room can hear what I'm listening to.  This is a big reason I don't like these.  If you don't care if you annoy people I guess it's ok.They can get uncomfortable in long listening sessions (like after 45 min or so), sometimes near the end of an album I have to take a break.  The headband or whatever that holds the cups to your ears is just too strong/tight for an adult head.  It's fine for short sessions.I actually had a pair of Panasonic RP-HTX7-W1 before these.  I fell asleep in them too often and the problem I described earlier with the cable happened so I got these to replace them.  I liked the Panasonic RP-HTX7-W1 better than these even though they have that bit of exposed cable by the earcups making them vulnerable to break if you fall asleep in them.  They were about the same price, but they were much more comfortable and sound was better ten-fold.,

56,"I went into the tablet market for two reasons: (1) I read mostly inside in the evenings and was tired of needing a book light for the e-ink reader and (2) I wanted to consolidate my travel electronics from phone + ereader + notebook.  The prices of straight tablets were outrageous to me when my primary purpose was to eliminate taking the laptop along to be able to review email and do moderate web browsing on a decent sized screen (the phone was way too small).  After reading several reviews and recommendations, I settled on a used Nook Color for both price and performance.  I have not been disappointed.  I have rooted my device for a full blown Android experience and a far superior web browser but rooting is not needed for the basics. I'm just someone who likes to tinker.Everyone needs to understand, this is an e-reader first and a tablet second even when rooted.  At $200, you cannot expect what you would get with a $500-$600 device.  But, it does what it is intended to do quite well.  At 7 inches the screen is comparable size to most e-readers and that was important to me for portability.  I simply swapped the e-ink reader for the Nook Color and it still fit perfectly in my purse.  The Nook Color is also really good for reviewing emails and smooth web browsing.  My rooted device has an overclocked processor so I have no problems with speed.  It's perfect for quickly reaching out to the web to check the latest news, weather, etc. and then get right back to reading my books.  I haven't had many problems running other Android tablet applications and have found that the problems I have had seem to be common problems with the applications themselves.If you want a premium e-reader, this is a super nice product at a great price.  If you're looking for a budget tablet without all of the bells and whistles (camera, gps, microphone) but that will handle the basics of email, web browsing, Netflix, Hulu Plus, and other consumption tasks, this is more than adequate and enjoys much more favorable reviews than similarly priced tablets (with the exceptions of the Kindle Fire and its own successor the Nook Tablet).  The bottom line with this little marvel is to keep your expectations in line with what you're paying for and what you're not paying for. If you expect a $200 version of the standard bearer (i.e IPad), then you'll be very happy.  If, however, you're expecting a $200 equivalent, then look elsewhere.,
","About 8 months ago i was in the hunt for my first PDA. Deciding that i wanted to go the Palm OS direction i had the choice of going with either the IIIxe or the Vx. Boasting roughly the same innards, the decision came down to form. Since i was willing to part with a little more money at that time i decided to go with the Vx. Let me say however that had i chosen the IIIxe i would not have been disappointed at all.Its a great Palm with upgradable OS. Something its Palm III brothers could not do.My only gripe with this Palm is that it is quite large. It is just as big as something i willing to carry in my pocket. Since i planned to bring my Palm with me where ever i go and i dont carry a bag, my pocket would have to be its main form of transportation. With an added case that would have made its overall size even bigger.Overall i really like this Palm. It has that classic look and is still one of the more powerful palms available. I would pick this over the m100's any day.As a last piece of advice i highly recommend that you do your research before you go and by any PDA. Dont believe the PocketPC ads or even the Palm ads. Talk to a lot of people and read a lot of reviews, particularly reviews that are made my people like you or me who aren't on Palm's or Microsoft's payroll.(Unfortunately) They will really tell you a lot of things that you will really want to know.Good Luck!,
","Good ""overall"" headphones for the (cost sold here) and for first foray into a better sound from the standard issue.For the price they have a better than usual articulation in the sound but...I bought them at a mall ($100) to get me through a ""quick need"" situation And I expected a little more from Sony. I've had many other cheap & high end ""cans"" as well thus seeing both sides of the spectrum, For my money.Price wise these Sony MDR V600's are pretty decent for someone wanting a quiet (closed-ear) headphone for not too much money ($80 or so). Like all ""cans"" they will sound better after you break them in about 30hrs. or so.I've used/tried these on both my desk/top computer (taking out the speaker jack & plugging these in after unscrewing the 1/4"" jack supplied) & on my ""High End"" Stereo system.Pros: Fit snuggly, adjust well, not too heavy; They work well (for large cans) and loud on a fair/low amount of energy; Decent amount of ""presence"" and spacial deffiniton; They have clear sound that won't show the immperfections of some recordings; A nice touch, one cord feeds both ears/speakers on the left side; Design style folds up small for it's overall size. Nice Length/design to the cord.Cons: A Weak bass response that becomes muddled if pushed (loud) at all. Mid range response is loud yet sounds ""flat"". And highs that sound ""clipped"" and not really distinct.(These comments may be a little harsh for the price range but I'm trying to steer you towards somthing better if you are willing to spend a little more)Anyone really wanting to dramatically improve their lisenting experience, and using/needing headphones on a regualr basis should spend a little more money and buy any sennheiser or a grado product. For the money, these are excellent headphone alternatives for whatever additional amount (more than this) your willing to pay.All in all, not a bad product solid good plastic construction in design, not a stand out (in sound) either.And for the money seemingly average. My advice is to spend a bit more and get somthing that you will really notice the difference in and say wow! Than you will have somthing that will last you for years to come...,

57,"I have a Amazon Kindle E-reader and few hundred books and was wondering ifthe ""Nook"" works on the same book format (mobi) as the kindle.  I Emailed a friend last night and he wrote back this morning  saying his Nook was dead in the water (it can happen with any of them)  What was funny was he said he wrote a review on the Nook  and said that he purchased a Color Nook and have enjoyed it for many years. Then one day it stopped working so he called customer service and was transferred to some foreign country where the woman could not speak English well,  so he asked to speak to another. Next a man came on who spoke worse that the woman so he asked if there was another person. When talking to the next person he was rude so he  asked customer service if he  could sent it in for repair.  The Nook Rep.  had gotten mad and said sure sent it back to North Korea and hung up the phone.  He said he  sent a number of Emails and they didn't  respond or when they did they say read the manual.  So John the Nook is great until you need service but to answer your question I can't open mine  to see the format so you may have to go by a Barnes and Nobel and ask them. You may need to hurry as Barnes and Nobel books stores may be closing the doors soon. Most everyone is switiching over to the E-readers.,
","Putting it simply, the Palm IIIxe is a five-star device. If you want just the highlights as to why, see my Short Notes below. If you want the full review, go to Detailed Notes further down.Short Notes:- Excellent quality overall, good ergonomics.- 8 MB RAM, easily sufficient to store a wide variety of applications plus data.- Has 2 MB flash memory, enough to handle upgraded (v3.5) OS.- Sharp, clear screen. Easy to read.- Graffiti handwriting recognition is forgiving and easy to master quickly.- Great battery life - should last over 30 days.- Built-in infrared port - easy data exchange between Palm devices.- Many available software applications, often freeware.- Excellent and thorough documentation.- Easy to learn how to use it - very intuitive if you hate manuals.- Syncs well with Microsoft Outlook, if you're so inclined.- Great price - a good investment.- - - - - - - - - - - -Detailed Notes:Spent a lot of time deciding which Palm OS model to go with, and finally picked the Palm IIIxe, primarily for the newer OS (v3.5), the 8 MB memory and the new lower price. Looked closely at the Palm m110 and Handspring Visor, units which offered attractive prices, but with 2 MB RAM, felt they didn't have enough memory. Also considered the Handspring Visor Deluxe, but on the two models that I had a chance to try out, the screens weren't the same quality as those of the Palm IIIxe, and nobody could explain it.You may also wish to consider the new Palm m105. See the notes at the bottom of this review for more details.To be fair, I also considered some of the newer Windows CE devices, but was put off completely by the hand recognition software. It was too slow and hard to use, so that idea was dropped quickly. Used to use a Windows CE device made by Casio, which I put aside awhile ago. Had initially been encouraged to purchase a Palm device by one of my co-workers, but I felt that the Windows CE 1.0 device with its tiny keyboard was the way to go. Then I found out that it ate batteries at a very high rate. Lived with this for awhile, but the business of hardware ROM replacement to upgrade the unit was disturbing.The Palm does everything I need it to, and in the month that I've had it, I've been pleasantly surprised by its versatility. The quality has proven to be excellent. The case of the IIIxe, though an older Palm design, fits the hand quite comfortably.The Palm IIIxe comes with 8MB of memory. In useful terms, this means that you can store approximately 12,000 addresses, 5-10 years of appointments (that's about 3000 appointments), 6000 to do items, 3000 memos, 800 e-mails and many applications. The available memory has been ample to download and store a wide range of applications along with the room to store related data. The IIIxe (along with some other models) has 2 MB flash memory, enough to handle the upgraded (v3.5) OS and the built-in applications. I also went to the Palm Web site and downloaded the latest (v.3.5.2) OS and installed it. There were absolutely no problems like I had heard about with other &quot;Palm-compatible&quot; devices.The screen is sharp, clear and easy to read, indoors or outside. Though I might have preferred a bit stronger backlight for those times where there isn't much light, have learned to adapt to it quickly.The Graffiti handwriting recognition is forgiving and easy to master quickly. One of the reasons I went to a Windows CE keyboard unit a few years ago was fear of having to learn yet another way of inputting data. I couldn't have been more wrong - it's easy and quite intuitive. What's even more important is that I'm now taking notes in meeting with the device that used to be done on paper.The battery life is outstanding. It should last thirty days or more under regular use. Since one of my complaints with the Windows CE units was short battery life, I'm impressed.The built-in infrared port allows you to transfer documentation directly from any other infrared enabled Palm device. This function works quite well. I've transferred memos to and from a Handspring Visor Deluxe and other Palm devices.There are many software applications available for the Palm PDAs, including a lot of shareware and freeware. The commercial programs that are available are top rate, and you can even find applications that will let you edit Word and Excel files. You can even connect to Oracle 8I databases with currently available software.The Palm IIIxe manuals are excellent, and do a thorough job of documentation. You may find, though, that this device is easy to learn with little reading. Its interface is very intuitive, and that's helpful if you dislike going through manuals.This PDA syncs well with Microsoft Outlook, which is extremely useful for corporate users. This is a straightforward operation in which you place the Palm IIIxe into the supplied HotSynch cradle and push the button on the base. The HotSynch operation creates a log of what was done, so you can confirm that everything was updated correctly.Picky point - comes with a mediocre lightweight plastic stylus. Order an upgrade (or the Palm 3-pack) immediately. You won't regret it.You might also want to consider the new Palm m105. Though it has a smaller screen than the Palm IIIxe, it has many of the same features but is packed in the same case as the popular m100.If you are looking for a reasonably priced PDA that can live up to its reputation, then this is a first-rate choice. The Palm IIIxe is a solid unit at a great price - an excellent investment.,
","After trying dozens of headsets for my phone I was a little hesitant to try another one, but I've heard good things about the Plantronics brand so I thought I'd give this a try. Most of the headsets I've used suffered from poor reception or poor design (or both). I was both pleased and surprised that the M175C excels in looks and function. Calls received were crisp and clear with no static or noise of any kind. The headset can be used over the head or folded to place behind the ear. It comes with a nice cushy ear piece if you decide to use it over your head, which I did. The volume control on the cord has a clip above it so you can attach it to your shirt or pocket and easily adjust the sound with the small thumb wheel. This works remarkably well and I find myself using it more than the volume control switch that's on my phone. Because the headset is so light even after wearing it for a couple hours I can hardly tell I have it on. It's so nice to finally be able to move around, make a cup of coffee, wave my hands in the air, or whatever.I highly recommend the M175C to anyone who wants a decent headset for their phone.,
"
58,"I was looking for a e-reader for our 13 year old's birthday this past October.  After researching the popular e-readers i.e. the Kindle Fire, I went with the Nook Color for one simple reason; the ability to Root it and turn it into an Android tablet, for a lot less! (It also takes a macroSD card). While you can find the Kindle rooted too, I found the Nook Color rooted was more readily available and more affordable. Since I was purchasing for a teen I  did not want to get a new or more expensive model.We purchased one that was already rooted to cyanogenmod 7.  You can also purchase an macro SD card here or on Ebay that is rooted for you if you already own a Nook Color.We connected it to our home wi-fi and Viola, she can do everything i.e. text free, download games and unlimited apps from the Market. The rooted Nook Color can do everything a tablet can do except for make or receive phone/video calls.Note, all rooted Nook Colors are not the same version.  We purchased one for our son for this Christmas and I did not notice it was not cyanogenmod 7.  This is relevant as it did not possess full access to all of the apps on the Google Play (or Android market) as our daughter's does.  You can update the Root software and I did that but I did not notice a change in its ability to download the other apps. But honestly, I was tired at that point and gave it to our son on Christmas as it was good otherwise and I doubt he would notice. LolThis model is perfect for my teens, but I am thinking about the Kindle Fire HD for myself because it has a good camera and I love photography.P.S. I also purchased a silicone case in yellow and it brightens up the dark tablet a lot.  (I purchased both Nook Color e-readers used for $66 and $87 each on Ebay.),
","I love my old Palm III. It is reliable, it syncs well with Outlook 2000  now that I've picked up PocketMirror, and the amoritized cost is now down  to pennies a day. But after years of use, I still hate that stupid little  stylus. My &quot;graffiti&quot; technique never got better than about 90%  accuracy, I can never remember how to punctuate, and don't get me started  on the little touchpad keyboards. So the Palm III keyboard is a godsend.  First off, its very cool. The key action is very good--soft and accurate.  I'm still fiddling with the delay settings, as the delay is a bit too slow  for my tastes. They keys are also a little too noisy for use in a meeting.  On the plus side, typing notes into the Palm is now a breeze. Better still:  the keyboard is collapsible, so its folds into a small rectangle not much  bigger than a Palm, but is very nearly full sized when unfolded. When  unfolded and locked, it is pretty stable (although I agree with those who  say you can't really use it on your lap). It looks great. What more can you  ask?I recently took my Palm III and keyboard to a conference. Everybody  else was lugging around laptops. I just unfolded my keyboard, snapped on my  Palm and rocked. All my Dilbertesque buddies were very jealous. (Palm  probably owes me hundreds in finders fees.) The only problem: Carrying my  Palm, the keyboard, and my cell phone is a lot of juggling. I need a small  case that carries all three. Anybody know one?,
","I've used more than a few headphones over the years, including some Sennheiser pro studio models. The Sennheiser' are typically uncomfortable after an hour or two, so if you plan to spend time at a board they can be painful, and depending on how long you where them the pain can last a day or two. The Sony V6 headset is very comfortable enough so that I've used them all night well actually all day and night without experiencing much discomfort, and the sound in my opinion is superior to anything I've tried recently. In the last few years I've switched to using earbuds for most of my casual listening and simply had forgotten how great a decent full size headset sounds.Over all, I've found this set to be very true reproducing recorded music, and are better than anything I've used in the sub $150.00 price range. One test I've used to compare sound reproduction in the past is to listen to a clean recording of a few acoustic instruments, especially the sound of a piano. If a headset can reproduce the timber and resonance of a full size piano they're usually a good bet. Being a acoustic string guy I also look at how well a set will reproduce the sound of a high end acoustic guitar, mandolin and violin. If they are accurate on those simple tests then I would grab them. This set does a fantastic job of reproducing the sound of everything I listen for with exceptional precision. I paid a lot more than a $100.00 for my Sennheiser' but this set sounds better and is much more comfortable to wear even for short periods of time.I would highly suggest anyone looking at these give them a try and see for yourselves just how good these sound. The range from 5 HZ-30 KHZ should be ample for anyone though the Bass is not exaggerated it is clean tight and powerful enough for myself anyway. Honestly these would be a very good choice for home studio or for casual listening, and if you've been spending hundreds on earbuds you have to give these a try.,
"
59,"A syndicated consumer advocate has a saying: ""I am willing to pay less for less.""  So am I.  I actually bought the Nook Color (NC) more for its tablet features than its e-book features.  I considered several tablets for at least double the price, but when the new Android OS was released for the NC, I decided to try it out.  I personally have not been disappointed.Here is what it doesn't have: camera, USB accessory support, fast processor, robust app forum, 3G model, and long battery life.  But as I said I am willing to pay less for less.  I primarily wanted it for basic web browsing (with Flash capability), movie playback, e-mail capability, and e-book capability.My experience has been great so far - I have had my NC for about six weeks.  I personally have had no problem with the web browser and it has met all of my needs.  Movie viewing has been fine and I have had no problems viewing them.  I use Handbrake to convert movies/videos to a format for the NC, and it works great.  I have several e-mail accounts I use for personal and business purposes, and the POP3 support the NC offers is perfect.  I am no longer tied to my PC, laptop, or confined to the small screen of a mobile phone.  As for the e-book reader, it's great as should be expected (My 8 year old daughter actually uses it for reading more than me.  I download books from the library for her, and she loves it.)  The notation, highlighting, and other reading tools are fine and it also has several options to customize the font and background color as well as the font size.Other reviewers have commented about crashes, but I have not had a single crash yet.  And I also don't think the stock Android OS is bad at all, but with this being my first experience with a tablet and Android OS, my expectations may have been lower than normal.  I am also hoping that the app market will improve over time.  I know I could root the OS, but for the time being I will just stick with what it came with.  To sum it up, I got what I paid for and am very happy (so far) with my NC,
","Do you hate it when you're using the Stylus pen on your new Palm Vx and every time you make a 'v' the palm displays a 'u' or when you make a 'k' the palm displays a 'y'?  Well palm has solved that big problem with the  smallest portable full-sized keyboard that has yet to be seen for the  Palm.Simply put, this is the best product out for the Palm so far.  Not  only is it the same size as a regular keyboard, minus the number pad, but  it also folds into one four-section square that snaps shut for easy  transportation wherever you take your pal pilot.It also functions  flawlessly with the Palm itself.  Just install the program on the disk that  comes with it onto the hard drive and then place the keyboard program on  the palm using the Palm Manager and you're all set to type away.Besides its technical strengths, it is also got a strong magnesium  casing to it to prevent damage to the keyboard itself in the event of  dropping it.  It also comes with it's own neoprene case for a little extra  padding.However, since I have to picky in order to best serve you guys  who are reading this review, it does have one or two slight problems.First, the shift button on the right side of the keyboard is a little  small.  Although aesthetically this may not be a big deal, once you start  typing you'll see that every now and then you his the up button rather than  the shift key and are typing in the middle of another sentence.Second,  although it's smooth sailing when the palm is attached to the keyboard,  taking it off and placing it on the keyboard is a little difficult.  The  reason is that the platform, although stable, is a little flimsy, comprised  of a plastic spine and a thin metal support.  One time I almost broke the  stand trying to get the palm out of the darn thing.Don't get me wrong  though.  Compared to all other keyboards (i.e. the IGo) and all the other  things that could have been wrong with it, the Palm portable keyboard is a  must buy for people who pack their palm full of notes or anything else.  It's quick and easy to use.  And although a little more expensive than the  IGo, it's worth the extra money and is a quality palm product...just like  the palm itself.  Enjoy!RevuMan:  Get out of the way Stylus, Keyboard  coming through...Peace!,
","Have you been considering good headphones? Have you searched the net and Head-Fi looking for advice? Look no further. If you want open headphones, choose the Sennheiser PX100 or Grado SR60 or SR80. IF you want closed, there is no better choice under $150 than the MDR-V6. Beware the other Sony models - they have a few good ones, but most are not so good, even a few that are pricier than this one. This is the same headphone (except for cosmetics) as the MDR-7506-great sound-easy to drive with or without an amp-durable-comfortableDo not hesitate - you won't regret these!Update 6/2010:These are still great, but Shure has since introduced two models (the SRH-440 and 840) that are very nice and worth a listen, some will certainly prefer them to the Sony. The 440 is very close in price as well. Also worth considering is the Denon AH-D1000 and D-1001, which when on sale are around $100. The Denons have great sound, perhaps slighlty more appealing to me than the Sony, but the Denon has absolutely the best comfort in any headphone that sounds decent and is under $500. The Sony wins on ruggedness and value, though, and the sound isn't worlds apart...,

60,"Purchased the Nook Color over a month ago.  I have been reading alot more since I got it , as it's so convenient to take everywhere.  I have not had any issues reading in the car on sunny days.  I also like the ability to read at night in my bed without any lights on, thus minimizing chances of waking up the wife.  The screen is very sharp and easy to read.  Magazines look awesome on the Nook Color and it's so much more convenient than having a stack of magazines clutter up the house.  I do not think it would be easy to read on the beach under direct sunlight, but it will be fine if you are under an umbrella (which is what I do when at the beach, as I'm cancer phobic). Wi-fi connection is automatic , seamless.  The web browser is better than I expected - and I use it often to read online newspapers and check email (way better than the Kindle's browser).There is to be a sofware upgrade in the next month or so which will enhance the NC even more.  Or you can root it yourself to turn it into a full blown tablet (at half the price of the Galaxy tablet!)The only drawback is the weight of the NC - it weights about the same as a hard cover book (though easier to hold than a hard cover book).,
","overall i've been pleased with the 990, the only drawbacks are(1) disappointed in the manufacturers claims about standard AA battery life, usually 15mins is average, not the hour and half claimed. NiMHs are a must, I use 1600maH which usually lasts 12 hours at least. Get real nikon, ship at least nicads, sure its a cost issue, but its very environmentally wasteful and poor customer relations to ship batteries that last for 15 mins or less. (2) The manual is weak, but is typical of translated manuals. 3) accessories are hard to get hold of, and the remote release is expensive (although its feature loaded) an IR or RF based remote would be nice, most other camera makers offer them. (4) suffers from red eye a lot. (5) low quality software on the PC, even lower on the MAC, crashes often on win2k, even after the update to camera firmware and PC software, crashes on first time use everytime. (6) menu access is slow, camera could do with a faster cpu, latest software release helps things somewhat but it could be better. (7) one very small thing that would only affect a few people, is the inbuilt IR filter for the lens, which means you can't do the near IR style photography thats popular with other digicams.other than those small quibbles, its generally an excellent camera, its a lot of fun to use.  Once you are setup with NiMHs and a decent sized CF card its easy sailing, we've had it for about two months and are still finding new things about it. Pictures taken are great, the jpg compression levels work well,the low is very low quality suitable for web pictures, but the high end is good, and the highest setting, with no compression is excellent.,
","I did months of research on the internet and asking around to friends in the ""audio industry"" and kept coming back to these headphones. It seems Sony did something right 20-30 years ago and hasn't strayed from the formula since. This set looks good, fits well, and sounds great. They definitely need a few hours to loosen up to get their best sound, but it's worth it. I feel like I hear everything when I'm listening to music. They block out outside sound well enough for me.The cups are comfortable and large enough for my ears. They are highly durable; I'm not afraid to throw them around a little bit, or even stuff them into my backpack. The coiled cord can get heavy at times. I wish it was more of a flat cord and had a cord wrangler like my old Sennheiser HD202s (a good low-end set), but if it helps it sound they way it does I'm more than okay with it.There is the higher-end-marketed Sony MDR7506 but these are basically the same. Some detailed reviews reveal only slight differences in the two sets' response patterns, but it's hardly noticeable. The only real difference is that the 7506 has a gold-tipped jack whereas the V6 does not. One reviewer noted that if the set was going to be plugged and unplugged repeatedly (I.e. NOT installed in a studio setting) the gold plating could eventually wear off. As I take my set on the go and plug into various devices, this was fine with me.You cannot find a better set of headphones for under $100. I would recommend these to anybody that likes music.,
"
61,"I was instantly the hero for my wife this Christmas, when I surprised her with a nook color under the tree. The device has great aesthetics, with a 7 inch IPS LCD display that is one of the most pleasing I've ever laid my eyes on, a thin and sleek profile, wonderful packaging, and nice support from Barnes and Noble, but that as Paul Harvey would say is only the beginning, this review is about the rest of the story.  At first glance this appears like just another eReader, but with a color screen for magazines and children's books swapped in for the normal eInk, but there is something different lurking beneath.  This device runs android 2.1 under the hood, heavily modified as it may be out of the box, and with that choice of operating system comes a potential access a world of hackery that is well beyond the reach of any other eReader.  In order to access this world you need to be willing to educate yourself a bit and root this device.  The process is actually quite simple (go to XDA-Developers forums or nookdevs.com Nook Color portal to read about it), and despite the dire warning disclaimers quite foolproof, and fully reversible (just in case you need warranty service).Once rooted, the device gains access to android market, where you can get thousands of apps, games, and tools for free (legally), or for a small purchase price.  Compared to the currently empty nook app store, the android market is bursting with exciting activity.  A rooted nook color gets access to the kindle app, so you can basically read all your amazon purchases on this device too.  Sony Reader app is coming soon from what I've heard, so you are probably going to get support for that store too.  Tied to the Kobo ecosystem, to borrow a phrase, there is an app for that.  Emulators for old game consoles are working nicely.  Playing Angry Birds on a 7 inch tablet is so much more fun than on a tiny 4 inch phone.  Stock browser lacks pinch to zoom, download Dolphin HD, and there you go.  Can't put app shortcuts and widgets on the home screen, home switcher and one of the freeware launchers (ADW is pretty nice) got your back.  A rooted nook color becomes something of a worthy competitor to the much more expensive iPad and Galaxy Tab.  Unlike real android phones and tablets, this does lack the physical menu, back, and search buttons, but a software softkey is installed upon rooting, so there are functional on-screen virtual equivalents to do the job.Don't get me wrong, there are some things that won't work, as nook color lacks a 3G radio, camera, or GPS.  The ROM is also a heavily modified version, so some abilities have been stripped out, and won't be available until a true custom ROM is available.  But more apps a likely to work than not due to a capable processor, ample storage packed underneath, and most importantly a talented and dedicated hacking community willing to experiment with their device and then educate others.  This is still early in the development life cycle of the nook color, so their are some rough edges to the process, some things will require resorting to the command line to fix.  Considering what you get for the money, this is probably the best handheld portable device on the market today.  An instant game changer without a doubt.,
","The Nikon Coolpix 990 has been a great camera-I'm extremely pleased with it.  This is a good choice for an experienced or ambitious amateur photographer.  Most of my previous experience has been with a Panasonic that cost a little over half what this one did.  In comparison to that camera, the Nikon has better color saturation, is quicker at the draw, and of course has more features....  I've been very pleased with the way that the 990 allows control over both shutter speed and aperture, color balance, focus and metering points and several more obscure settings.All digital cameras are battery pigs, and this is no exception.  A good  optical viewfinder (including support for zoom) is important in a camera like this for two reasons.  First, the color screen is useless in bright sunlight, but second, it provides you with a battery-saving option of turning off the monitor.  An LCD screen on top of the camera provides a readout on the most common settings (aperture, shutter speed, resolution &amp; quality, storage, 'ISO', flash settings, manual focus distance).  Japanese electronics tend to have lots of features, reached through obscure combinations of buttons.  While I would hardly categorize this camera as being 'completely intuitive,' most of the functions are pretty easy to operate.  The more advanced settings are reached through a tabbed menu on the monitor, which is reasonably easy to use.  I've also found that the monitor is very accurate in both brightness and tone.  The monitor has several different modes-if you leave it turned on, the default mode is to superimpose some of the most-used camera settings over the picture.  This is similar to but not a complete duplicate of the readout on the top LCD screen.  You can also leave the menu on, superimposing it over the image.  While this covers part of the image, it also makes menu options available for immediate use.  Unless you are in very bright light, what you see on the monitor after taking a picture is what you get-I've never been disappointed that a picture didn't turn out like it appeared on the monitor (brightness and hue are adjustable).  Although the monitor is small, the view feature lets you zoom in and scroll around on stored images so that you can look at them more closely.The configuration of the camera is unusual, splitting the viewfinder, lens and flash from the other half of the camera and allowing their separate rotation.  I usually don't rotate the lens, but sometimes it is convenient to do so, allowing you to take pictures over your head or around corners.  I bought a small minipod and found that the rotating lens assembly provides some extra flexibility when clamping the camera to whatever happens to be available.  The on-board flash is OK, but the red-eye reduction facility doesn't work very well.  If you don't use an off-camera flash, you're living with substandard lighting anyway, but there are more effective red-eye reduction systems on other built-in flashes.It doesn't matter how slick the controls are, or how good it looks if it doesn't take acceptable pictures.  I've been quite please with the camera's performance in many different light conditions.  I've had fun capturing the Christmas lights in Z&uuml;rich, and my best picture was a misty Fall scene on Mt. Pilatus with yellow and red leaves.  It took me 6 tries to get the exposure right (that's why you buy a camera like this), but it perfectly captured that dreamy backlit scene and its Autumn colors.  Pictures don't always come out as rich as negative film, but they aren't bad and when they are good, they can be very good.I've found that close-ups work well, and macro mode is fun.  I've even used my 990 to copy signs or even pages in a book.  It is a quick way to capture text that you need to refer to later.  After you've taken a picture of a diagram or text, view it and use the zoom function to make sure that what you've just taken is legible in the monitor.The camera has more continuous shooting options than I know what to do with.  The multi-shot 16 feature lets you create a single collage that consists of 16 pictures.  That's the kind of gimmick that you can't use very often without wearing out your audience's patience.  If you want to create a short movie, though, you can do that too.Speaking of night pictures, I had a terrible time figuring out the self-timer.  When you put it in self-timer mode, the close-up icon (flower) comes on, and so does the red eye icon.  It turns out that you are stuck with this configuration, which isn't really optimal for night scenes. ...  Given the availability of multi-second shutter speeds, and a sensitivity adjustment providing an effective speed of ISO 400, some owners will undoubtedly pay for the MC-EU1 release, and the bulb setting is pretty much useless without it.I like the USB cable.  Once you've loaded Nikon View on your computer, connecting the camera to a USB port and turning it on automatically makes the camera accessible as if it were a removable drive.  I've been traveling with just the USB cable and find it a very convenient way to pull pictures into my laptop and delete them from the memory card.  Connection of the USB cable automatically turns off the color monitor, and subsequent battery drain seems to be low....  I think most Nikon owners would appreciate a more advanced text than this, but it is comprehensive and has helped me better utilize my camera.In summary, automatic operation is very good, and if desired, this camera offers the ability to control every aspect of the photography process.  It has less waiting time than many other digital cameras I've used, it is relatively easy to use, and it takes good pictures.  It's a winner!,
","After moving to Guam, I cannot find any decent Audio Store on this island! High-end audio store is out of the picture here! I decided to switch to computer-based music system and a pair of good headphone (fortunately, I am not addicted to high-end hype). By doing some homework, I found a very decently priced &#34;Audirvana Plus&#34; for AIFF playback. However, I still need a pair of decent headphone to complete my MacBookPro + Audirvana Plus music playback &#34;system&#34;. Please believe me, you do not want to have too much $$$ stuff in your apartment/house on this island; otherwise, you may find them &#34;all gone&#34; when you go home! That is why I target on a pair of headphone less than $100.Again, going on the internet, doing some Google search, I found this Sony MDR-V6. OK, the following is my 1 week impression on MDR-V6...1. Fresh out of the box, it sounds a bit harsh, and I felt sound fatigue after about 30 minutes of continuous listening. But, this is not the &#34;problem&#34; at all.2. I ran in this headphone by playing music into it continuously for 3 days, and the sound is much better now! I am expecting it will keep improving after about 1 to 3 month(s) to have both drivers settled. (Will update about this part later).3. The sound of this headphone is like what they are designed for. Almost no coloration.Before writing this review, I saw two extreme ends of reviews. Most people were using this pair of headphone for years, and some reviews are cursing Sony MDR-V6... The story may (very likely) be that Sony has discontinued this headphone in Japan, and the replaced model is MDR-CD900ST (V6 was the CD600ST). In Japan, all V6's are actually  &#34;imported&#34;! Sony actually moved the original production line of V6 to China, and later, to Thailand. Since I only own this headphone for one week, I really are not in the position to judge the QA of V6. Mine V6 is printed &#34;Made in Thailand&#34; on the box. Maybe few years later; if I still remember this review, I could provide more info about how long does mine V6 live.,

62,"I purchased my nook color in june of 2012. i had been online looking at various e-readers and comparing the features. i finally decided on the Nook color.**pros**-beautiful screen-very responsive touch screen-excellent battery life (you must leave the wi-fi off unless you are using it)-good overall feel to the device..seems solid and fits nice in your hands.-pretty decent web browsing (youtube etc)-custom sized text sizes, (you can go from Small to very large)-expansion micro sd card slot, (supports up to 32gb) for music, documents etc, note you CANNNOT Store e-books purchased from bn.com on the card!**cons**-diffcult to read in direct sunlight, (due to the technology used for the color display)-books CAN Be expensive, but are generally slightly less than retail, no physical book means you don't have tons of read books cosuming space around your home.-nearly have to pay for ALL APPS, (angry birds, etc)-Wimpy single speaker that is HARD to hear even with volume turned all the way up- if no screen protector is put on this device, you will have greasy smudges and fingerprints galore. invest in a good screen protector i would suggest the 2X caseen Glareshatter. here is the link: [...]-sometimes the nook color will freeze, prompting you to restart.also, you will want to purchase a cover for the nook color to keep it from getting scratched, or banged up here is the link to the black moko case i have.[...]Considering what it does, it is a great device, its not a $800.00 ipad, so if you purchase this with the expectation of it functioning like an ipad YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. this is a nice color e-reader with basic web browsing, email reading and sending capabilites, so if you wanna check your email and do some light web browising, this is for you. the battery life is amazing, but this is only true if you KEEP THE WIFI OFF. if your wifi is left on, and your not using it, battery life will be short. i only turn on wifi when im downloading a new book (takes about 30 seconds) and when im doing email or web browsing. the web browsing feature is ok, but no subsititue for your desktop or notebook. just keep this in mind.all in all, a good purchase, very pleased with my nook color!update 11/15/13*** e-reader seems to be performing well.if you LEAVE THE WIFI OFF you can get very long battery life.this device was great for its time, but since being released back in 2010 better things have come out.its fine for reading..but not much else.,
","My kids are playing with an old toy pair of binoculars. It is missing an eyepiece, it is old and abused for years.  I decided to look for a more decent pair so they can enjoy more their newly found hobby.The first entry after searching online came out to this little guy. It is only around twelve bucks at the time of this review which is just perfect for its purpose.  It also shows hundred of reviews that are positives.It came with a neat black case and a piece of cleaning cloth. Some manufacturers make them with cheapo plastics, this is made of rugged rubberized construction.  It looks like it can withstand some rough handling by my kids.Right in the middle sits a ring for  focusing. My eyes needs prescription glasses, but it provides wide range of focusing that I don't even need my prescription glasses to see clearly on it. Now, that is convenient.  You can also adjust the distance between the two eyepieces easily so it can adapt to both kids and adults.  The only thing missing is a zoom, but I often see that feature only on more expensive and bulkier binoculars.Dont expect a sophisticated lenses at this price. The lenses are basics but capable.  They are also small, making the images dimmer than those with bigger lenses.The only thing I am disappointed is the width of view or coverage.  Most of the time, when you go to a concert or a game, the only thing you will see is the head of the performer.  This is worse when you are not sitting very far because sometimes you want to see the whole body, the whole group, or even part of the stage. Well, I guess it is pretty much the standard.  But it will be great if there are other versions of these binoculars available in other magnification, let's say 4x, or 6 times.  In that case, I will grab another pair right away, specially if they offer them at the same price.,
","These are okay headphones for the money but the earpads are totally faulty; they don't last very long, which is really annoying. I had to replace them at least once a year, at additional cost and frustration because they split open. While you can buy replacement ear pads it is really a pain to install them. Sony simply needs to make more durable ear pads.  The other thing is that they cook your ears. After a while wearing these, your ears start to feel really hot. The ear pads also press against your ears so they start hurting after wearing these for a while. These are not made for long listening periods unfortunately.These headphones look cool and provide fairly good isolation and good sound quality over the entire frequency range. They are the same as the more expensive MDR-7506 models except these don't say ""Professional"" on them and have less of a warranty.For the price, these headphones are fairly comfortable (but not the most comfy headphones available), and they sound pretty good although I've certainly heard better. There is little to no sound leakage and they provide good isolation in a foldable design that looks cooler than most other headphones. I would say these are good entry-level monitoring headphones (for audio engineers, DJs, etc.). For music lovers, they are certainly usable but you won't get that 'tickle me ears' type of 'Wow!' feeling from the sound out of them like with some other higher end headphones.If it wasn't for the truly faulty ear pads, I would give these a higher rating.,

63,"Not quite a full-fledged tablet, not a dedicated e-reader...and that's OK with me for $249!  I had my first two NookColors replaced, the first due to a SD card holder spring that failed after 90 days and the second due to an unresponsive touch screen and problems with powering on.  Customer service had me on the phone for about 45 minutes and took me through two factory re-sets before I finally convinced them to replace my second unit.  Note that all replacements of defective devices are re-furbished, not new.  Finally, I am experiencing what Barnes & Noble had in mind.  NookColor #3 works great and now that I have a unit with a touch screen that works as it should I am finally realizing what a great little machine this can be, with a really solid e-reader and nice add's like Pandora and other apps, as well as wi-fi web browsing that really works well for a function that is secondary to the NookColor's primary role as an e-reader.  I really appreciate being able to listen to any selection from my iTunes library straight off the SD Card while reading or surfing the web or playing around with a couple of the apps I bought. Standard quality MP4 video files play smoothly, and most were converted to that format via third party software on my PC (My VideoConverter). The app store is still under-developed and I really wish this had 3G capability so I'd have an excuse for taking it with me more often, but at such a low price compared to 3G tablets, I have become very enamored of this machine.  The questionable quality control, a screen that is reflective in bright light and the weight of the device with cover are my only complaints, and if I had not encountered the quality problems I mentioned this would have been a solid 4- or 5-Star review, especially considering the price vs. competing tablets (because it really is in the tablet category, especially with Android 2.2 froyo installed).,
","I originally was educated about the audio beauty of Sennheiser headphones over 5 years ago, having only experienced the most basic of Sony headphones that you would get at a local electronics store. I was under the assumption that headphones are headphones, what could possibly be different about a pair with a name I had never heard of versus a pair made by an electronic giant like Sony? As I slipped the Sennheisers on my ears, I never looked back.Ignorance was NOT bliss in this case.Soon after I got to experience what music is supposed to sound like, I quickly purchased a pair of Sennheiser headphones of my own and have enjoyed them ever since. From their cool, velvety feel to the crispness of audio clarity, I challenge anyone to find a headphone manufacturer that exceed Sennheiser.My Sennheisers have given me hours upon hours of sonic joy and I guarantee you will not be disappointed if you give them a chance. Are Sennheiser headphones more expensive? Are Mercedes more expensive? I am sure if you ask a Mercedes owner to give up their keys for a Ford they would laugh at your just as quickly as I would if someone wanted to replace my Sennheiser headphones with a Sony pair from Best Buy.You will NOT be disappointed.***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION,
","This is a nice little radio - compact, gets very good reception for me, has good bass response and is quite light.  It fits easily in a shirt pocket.Of course the ear buds that came with it are trash.  But that's the same with every audio device you buy - shouldn't be a real shocker to anyone in this day and age of mp3 players, iPod's, personal devices etc., that you're paying for the device, not the ear buds.  Just realize that going in and buy yourself a decent set of earphones or earbuds at the same time you buy the unit.My major complaint is how the favorite station settings work.  Setting up your favorites is easy enough, but to listen to them, you have to click a ""recall"" button, then rapidly tune up or down to get to whichever station you want and click ""recall"" again before it resets to normal tuning mode.  If you want to go to another favorite station, you again have to click ""recall"" but this time, instead of starting on the station you were last on, it goes to the bottom of the list, so you (again) have to scroll all the way through your favorites.  I like it much better on their other radios - like the Sangean DT-400W, where you just click a favorites button and you can then scroll at will and when you turn the power off and on again, the station is what you left it with last.  This constant business of hitting the recall button, then repeatedly scrolling through your list, hitting the recall button again, is quite annoying.What otherwise would be a 5 star rating gets 2 stars knocked off as a result.,

64,"I am new to nook color and bought over 40 books on the day I purchased the device, naively thinking that all Publishers adhered to the text size options available within nook (the 6 letter 'A' images incrementing from very small to the largest). Much to my dismay when I later had time to go through all of the books I'd purchased and play with text sizing and font options, I found that this was not the case. Indeed, the maximum size for many of the texts was too small to be read by people with visual impairments.My plea to Barnes & Noble, Publishers, Amazon and other vendors who produce ebooks is to please keep pepole with visual disabilities in mind and adhere to standards that will meet various needs. In the US alone, there are millions of partially sighted people who need for text to be enlarged, made bold, underlined, etc. My feeling is that 'corrected' versions of these books should be released and people who have already purchased them should be given the option to get free download replacements.Personally, I have visually impaired people in my family and I will no longer purchase any book that does not at least allow for larger text sizes.Nook color is a great device but in the end it is only as good as the software and texts that is uses, so for now I rate it 3 stars until the above issues are addressed and implemented. I know I speak for many, and thank you for your time and consideration.,
","There have been so many reviews here I almost didnt write one but with the lack of reviews by producers I decided to add one more to the list.If you're producing audio like myself you already know theres no replacement for a good set of monitors. That said there's a few reasons you may be mixing through a set of cans.My reasons are that my studio is sometimes mobile and that I'm often mixing in my apartment (I've found that boxers and a t-shirt are a superior choice for studio apparel).I'm running an Mbox2 with Pro-Tools 7 (sometimes switch to Nuendo... don't hate me... hush now Abelton users).I also use these with my Ivory Keys VST and it sounds pretty nice, I think they add a bit of warmth when compared to a set of Mackies, could be the spatial difference, but I actually like it better through the Senns, a bit more personal I guess.That said, I feel pretty happy with the sound from these cans.I've been using them for almost a year now, extensively.They're a bit lacking in the low-ends when I push them, but when you pair them up with an analyzer you can usually compensate pretty nicely with a combo of visual and audio reference.They are open-ear, so dont expect your vocalists to be using them in the sound booth or you'll be recording the sound coming from the headphones along with the vox. For the producer, the only real place for these is in the mix down if you're trying to be quiet... or your one of those weirdos who uses cans for some bizarre voodoo mixing ritual.(I've heard of these guys but never met one)They are definitely more comfortable than some of the other headsets I've tried, Grado's being the least comfortable, Sony's aren't bad.Sometimes I seem to put them on wrong and my ears start hurting pretty quickly but if I slide them around on my head a bit so my ears are good and centered I can wear them for a few hours before I need to take em off.I think the most important thing to note here is my experience with Sennheisers customer service.Recently I snapped the headset in half, dunno if it was from cheap plastic construction or just lots of use. Regardless I contacted Senn and asked what I needed to do, assuming I'd have to send them in and wait a week to get them fixed. Instead Senn offered to just send me a new headband and I could replace it myself.Because of the modular construction of these cans that will be pretty easy to do and lets me keep using them while I wait for my replacement.Needless to say, that made me pretty happy.The cords firmly snap in and out of the cans via 2 pronged plugs, nice for those who accidentaly step on the cord while they stand up.On a consumer level note, if you are listening to MP3's or any compressed audio format in a portable device... or any device for that matter, dont buy these, you're wasting your money.I'm not insulting you, I'm being serious.There are cheaper alternatives for compressed audio.If you like your music and can't blast your speakers for some reason or the other, then I'd say these are a pretty nice set. Not the best for sound but close enough that the price and comfort make up for the slight difference you may hear in a set of (very uncomfortable) Grado's.For those of you who are worried about reproducing the ""original sound"" of a recording, you need to laugh at yourself for a minute and realize that we process those sounds pretty thoroughly before we even bounce them to a track. Compressors, EQ's, Verbs, etc., sometimes before the signal even hits the sound card it's gone through a pre-amp. Aside from that the difference between audio still in the DAW and a bounced track is pretty dramatic. You're just not going to hear what we hear in the studio. Go with what you like.Some like it crispy, some like it warm.If you can listen to your favorite track through the headphones before you decide to buy them, do that.Leave em on your head for a while see how they fit.I recommend trying them out if your searching for a set.They work nicely for my purposes.,
","I am a radio nut. I even have one in the shower. I needed a radio to replace my Sony SW-1. I live in the California central valley between Fresno and Bakersfield, the radio reception here is horrible and I like to go to sleep with the radio on and ear plugs in. With my Sony I could get fair Am/Fm and SW. With the Sangean I get great Am/Fm and SW. I get stations on the Sangean that were nothing but static on the Sony. It's a little bigger than my Sony but has some great features the sony didn't. Like setting the length of time before it turns off and the auto station select (I used it for FM, I like all kinds of music).The handy display light that turns off after 30 seconds. And to pull in those weak stations, a simple button to change to the fine tune mode. Also handy is the lock button that locks the front pannel (It keeps me from changing the station by bumping the buttons while falling asleep) If you don't mind a big radio and want one for AM get a CC radio. If you want a small radio to travel with or a small radio for your night stand, this is the best for the price.Pros: Great reception, easy to use, small, comes with a nice leather case, ear plugs, external antenna and ac adapter.Cons: No wrist strap.,

65,"I purchased a NOOKcolor a couple of months after it came out.  Within a week I had to return it because it would not charge.  A lot of hassle was required to get a replacement and it took a couple of weeks to get to me.  Once I got it set up I used it about 7 times and it locked up on the home page.  It took 2 days of conversing with a tech before they finally decided to send me another replacement.  I received my 3rd one and it lasted exactly 43 hours.  Screen went black and the lower right corner heated up to the point it was too hot to hold.  This time they were nicer about agreeing to send me a replacement.  The 4th one is sitting, unopened, in a box in front of me.  Well, after having trouble with three of them I no longer feel I can trust this device to work consistently (unless you consider always breaking as a form of consistency!) and would like to get a complete refund.  So far B&N; (the site I bought it from) won't do that for me.Moral(s) of the story:1. Stick with a Kindle - I bought an early version of it and still love it.  And if you want color go wtih the Kindle Fire.2. Only buy products though Amazon since they are very lenient and curteous about returns.  (They weren't selling the NOOKcolor when I purchased mine.)It's now about a year later and I'm still trying to get my money back.  My plan is to take this unopened box, all receipts and emails to a nearby B&N; store and hope pleading in person will get me a full refund.Wish me luck!,
","UPDATE #2:  I sent the headphones to Sennheiser for repair.  After ""repair,"" the phones exhibit the same problem.  I will contact Sennheiser again because I think it's unacceptable for $400 headphones to have this problem.UPDATE:  I decided that the creaking was intolerable.  I tried to make a return through Amazon, but that window had closed.  So now I have initiated a repair at Sennheiser, as I think there is a manufacturing defect.  Very disappointing.When I looked more closely at the problem, I saw that most of the noise comes from the two joints where the earpads meet the headband.  Those joints are designed to rotate slightly.  The rotation should be smooth (as it is on my HD580s), but in this case there are about 12 little hiccups in the rotation on each side.  The joints are grinding, and each stutter in the rotation translates as a creak.INITIAL REVIEW:  I have been using the HD600 for a few weeks, and am disappointed to find them more than a little annoying, unlike my HD580 pair.  First, they seem too tight & press too hard around my ears.  I have tried bending them wide open (carefully), but that hasn't improved how they feel.  Second, there is a lot of structural noise conveyed into my head through my bones -- noise from the ear pads and from the headband.  If I yawn with them on, there's a little cascade of noise. If I move my head at all, there is noise.  The tight fit may be exacerbating this.  I am wondering if different ear pads would improve the situation.  Maybe memory foam?  I don't recall that other people reported this problem, so I'm surprised by it.  It is really distracting, and it's not what I expect from a $400 set of headphones.,
","I bought this radio as a replacement for the Kaito KA11, which inexplicably stopped working in the AM/MW band and gave me concerns about Kaito's quality control.This is a basic shortwave/FM/AM radio, large enough to provide decent room-filling sound yet small and light enough to fit into a backpack. As I am going on a trip to Asia and will be going to places where shortwave radios are banned, it's also cheap enough to leave behind somewhere.There aren't many bells and whistles on this model: no exact frequency readout, no sleep timer, no alarm, no presets, no ""wide"" or ""narrow"" filter, no treble and bass settings, no external antenna jack, no tuning outside the basic FM/AM and shortwave broadcast bands; not even a carrying case. It has a headphone jack and input for A/C outlet and that's about it.I compared it to my Sony ICF-7600GR and found the sensitivity to be about equal. I was able to tune into the usual shortwave powerhouses: China Radio International, Radio Bulgaria, Radio Havana Cuba, Radio Canada International and VOA Africa service without much effort. The Sony obviously provides better selectability though; the Sangean had far more interference from adjacent stations. This Sangean, like all analogue models, also suffered from frequency drift and had to be re-tuned from time to time.Build quality is fair. It's light enough not to add much additional weight to my backpack, but as others have noted, the knobs are flimsy. Speaker quality is good. It's not too tinny sounding.If you're looking for a cheap, small, light travel radio, or a backup radio for emergencies, this is the radio for you. If you're interested in shortwave DXing (viz., listening to long distance stations as a hobby) this radio may be too limiting and frustrating. If you intend to give this radio heavy or rough usage, it may not last.,
"
66,"The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc.  It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy.  A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own ""flavor"" of Android for this reader.  While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption.  As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan.  You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment).  Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).,
","Sennheiser HD600 is one of the best headphones in the market, which offers exceptional sound quality at a price much lower than one has to pay for comparably good speakers. They are often compared to Grado RS-1 or Sony MDR-F1. Although it is extremely hard to find a place where you can compare all three of these top-of-the-line models, those people who had this chance agree that the difference in sound quality is so subtle that it is a matter of personal taste which one to prefer.The sound quality of HD600 has been discussed in several reviews posted before mine. I can only add that the best way to hear the difference is to listen to the classical music or to jazz, where natural sound is paramount. Electronic music will sound good also in much cheaper headphones. There are several things which I learned from my experience that were not mentioned in reviews posted before mine:1. Break-in period. As taken from the box, HD600 sounded not better than $7 headphones from a local drug store, and I was very close to returning them. However, I accidentally found on the web that headphones need a break-in period, i.e., they are supposed to play for about 24 hours before they can reach their full sound potential. The sound quality transformation after the break-in period was truly amazing, and the difference between HD600 and cheap headphones became striking!2. With a 300 Ohms impedance, HD600 need quite some power. Neither portable CD players, nor computer sound cards can drive them - the volume is low, and the bass is gone completely. This was the only thing about HD600 that I got disappointed with - they can be used only with a dedicated high quality amplifier. It is possible that headphone jacks on DVD and CD players may also be not adequate. I ended up buying a Creek OBH-11 headphone amplifier in order to have something that can drive my HD600 and provides the sounds quality that I expected.3. Many people say that HD600 is very comfortable. Frankly, I saw more comfortable headphones. It may be a matter of the head size (I am a big guy), but I would be happy if the pressure on my ears could be reduced. I am getting tired of wearing HD600 after about 40-50 minutes.But the sound IS great !!!,
","Perhaps you want to dip a toe in the waters of shortwave radio listening. In my case, I wanted to give my kids a different perspective of the world around them than that which comes from the cliches and stereotypes presented on TV and in the movies. I'd had a decent Sangean shortwave a number of years ago but was hoping that as technology marches forward, decent functionality might be available in cheaper units.Right off the bat, let's discard AM (medium wave) and FM. Those are commonly available. I have no interest in introducing my kids to the red-faced belligerents who populate the AM band. There's no reason to listen to FM radio if someone has a decent CD collection for the car. Even though the SG-622 offers both AM and FM, I bought this solely for the shortwave.Taking a cue from other reviews here I expected that shortwave reception would be weak, but also expected that connecting this to the antenna that had been used with my component stereo system would significantly increase the number of listenable signals received. First I should say that without the external antenna this unit is a paperweight. Listening at night as I used to do with the better shortwave receiver, the only thing this picked up in multiple listening sessions was three or four religious broadcasts that probably are readily available on AM radio if the political blowhards haven't driven everybody else off the dial.Adding the external antenna from the component stereo did make a significant difference in reception. More signals were indeed detected. Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of them were unlistenable. I'm not a shortwave enthusiast so I'm only speculating that what such listeners mean by ""sensitivity"" or ""selectivity"" is a radio's ability to home in on a signal while suppressing general static and noise. Most of the time when some kind of signal would be detected, the SG-622 delivered it as one chunk of coherent sound bobbing about in a sea of white noise. Sifting through band after band of unlistenable signals turned up a handful of broadcasts that were coherent but significantly noisy. No Radio Australia or Radio Moscow or english language broadcasts from points around the globe, but rather, mostly just the occasional foreign language broadcast peppered in with the already mentioned doctrinal teachings. In short, the effort required wasn't worth the parsimonious results delivered.It's probably a safe guess that ""drift"" means either a signal slightly changing frequencies or a receiver's inability to stay locked onto a fixed signal. With the SG-622 I found that signals repeatedly drifted, to where it was best if I kept one hand on the dial in an attempt to follow the signal's shifts one way or the other. Never had to do that with the shortwave receiver I'd used in the past.Listening to broadcasts from around the world can be a fascinating pastime, an activity to share with the kids. But if you want to stick a toe in those waters just to see how you like it, or how the kids take to it, without spending too much, this unit just isn't going to drum up any enthusiasm. It would be like buying a used Yugo to see if calling the tow truck from the side of the road inspires your teen to take up driving. This fails the effort/reward equation, this fails the cost/reward equation, and even when it lands a signal, it's the audio equivalent of watching a snowy TV screen. Don't abandon the idea of trying shortwave radio, but please, walk up the ladder to a better, higher priced model that will deliver enough listenability so that you or your kid can make an informed decision on pursuing this further.,

67,"I recently bought a Nook and when I bought it home for the first time, I was impressed. The user interphase (much improved over Nook 1st gen) was optimized for the large touchscreen and is much better than the simple list UI of the new Kindle touch. Holding the device was also pleasant and the page turn buttons were a great addition that the Kindle touch desperately lacks. Hardware and software wise, the product itself is perfect as a functional and easy to use e-Reader.However, when I started to look for books to purchase (they were about investing if you were curious), out of the five books I tried to find, I ended up only being able to find one of the books I wanted. I purchased this device having read half a dozen reviews, and the reviewers all commented on how comparable the book selections for Amazon and Barnes and Noble are, but the truth is, B&N; still has a ways to go.I am aware the the Nook supports e-pub which allows it to read generic pdf files (something that the Kindle can't do), but one of the features I look for in e-readers is convenience. Having to buy a book from Google books on my laptop and then transferring it to my Nook is not convenient. If only this device had the Kindle store on it...Bottom line: When you buy an e-reader, you're also buying into the manufacturer's entire ecosystem. With the Kindle, you're buying material from an expanding and reliable retailer that's not going away anytime soon. With the Nook, you're buying material from a reputable but inconsistent company whose mettle has yet to be tested in the e-reader space.Two word recommendation: Research selection (before purchase)I hope I've helped.,
","I'm a planar/ortho guy, both in speakers and headphones.  I have a set of HiFiMan HE-400s that I was enjoying until they were dethroned by a set of Audeze LCD-2.  I absolutely love the Audeze, and find them to be extremely neutral (do we really know what neutral is, though?) with my HiFiMan EF-5 amp, with a seductive midrange.But this review is about the HD-600.  A friend lent me his extremely tweaked Bottlehead Crack AND his HD-600s, since the Crack will not drive my planars well.  My god, I really love the HD-600 on that amp!  After doing some comparisons and finding that it is very true that the Crack will not drive low-impedance cans well, I pulled out my little Schiit Magni to do more listening.  The Senns sound fabulous on that amp, too (and so do the LCD-2, and in my opinion best the Senns just by a bit).So, that's a lot of typing to give some background.  I just wanted to say that it would be highly unlikely for anyone to be disappointed by these headphones.  I found them to be really great sounding, even in the company of my Audeze cans, so I might just have to have a set, if only to be able to enjoy, say, OTL headphone amps.I think these should be on your short list if you want some accurate headphones.,
","I purchased three 500GB versions of these back at the beginning of 2009 for a system build where I used two in a RAID configuration and the third drive as a back up. Just 8 months later all three drives are failing: each has a SMART problem (detected by Windows and by Seagate SeaTools) and two of the three also fail SeaTools short drive tests. I use these drives in an extremely well ventilated Antec P182 case that has a separate hard drive bay that keeps them isolated from the heat produced by the motherboard and graphics card, so heat is NOT the reason these drives are failing. I believe the real issue is with poor quality components. I use a fair number of other Seagate drives and have had no problems with them. I bought literally about a dozen 2.5"" 7200rpm drives for upgrading various notebooks (Mac and PC) without any issues--for a while I was replacing all my friend's drives after I sped my macbook 13 drive up from 4200RPM to 7200RPM and was showing everyone the performance improvements... In any case the problems I've had with these drives seem to be an issue limited to this particular version.The only positive thing I can say is that at least I learned these drives were going bad before they completely died. I was able to back up all my data to my NES array. I've filled out RMAs through the Seagate webpage and will hopefully get replacement drives soon, but I don't know that I'll actually trust them considering my 100% fail rate with the three I already own. I may decide to replace them with WD drives instead.,

68,"Product shipped quickly, and arrived slightly ahead of schedule, even from the other side of out country.The stated storage capacity is rather misleading. It says 2gb, but half of that seems reserved for the system, and most of what's left is reserved for B&N;'s ebooks. That leaves about 250mb for the rest of your library.Fortunately, a 4gb microSD card cost me a measly $5. Even better, memory card integration is seamless.Amazon's got a great price, too. $10 cheaper than anyone else. Ironic, considering the Nook is their direct competitor.One thing to take into consideration is that the page numbers are synced with the actual pages of the ebook, regardless of font size or line spacing, so you can turn through page 85 two or three times before getting to page 86. It's a little weird, but not a major issue.I got my paws on one of these things in the store, and I'm still surprised at how light and small it is.The last consideration (not really an issue, but an odd choice on their part) is the lack of a file manager on the device. You have to plug the Nook into a computer to delete files. However, it's irrelevant, since all of my ebooks are on the memory card, and I bought a USB adapter for that very reason.All in all, this is a fantastic product, and I am very pleased with it.,
","I have a G4 tower Mac that did have a built in Ethernet.  Unfortunately, a lightening strike took out the port and I was forced to get a PCI card to replace the port.  The first card I bought was the D-Link DFE-530TX+.  I was excited because the box clearly said that the card would work with Macs and that the ""minimum requirement"" was OS 10.2.They lied.  OS 10.2 is the _maximum_ for this card.  For most people, it won't work with 10.3 and up.  D-Link has no driver for 10.3 or higher, only 10.2.  A google search shows that some people have been able to get the card to work with 10.3.  I couldn't.  I tried several different drivers (some users recommended a driver from Realtek) and none worked.It's my guess (and totally a guess) that this card is really only for older Macs that are limited to 10.2.  D-Link doesn't seem to have any intention of supporting modern Macs.This is the second D-Link product I've used (the first was a cable modem) and I've been disappointed both times.  I can't speak for Windows users, but this company doesn't deserve Mac business.,
","I've had this keyboard for about 1 year now (I think).  It's only negative is how it works with existing computer furniture that I have.With the curved edge and higher profile (2 inches high)  this keyboard may be a bit big for some computer desks.  It effectively takes up about 10 inches in depth and 19-1/2 inches in width.  My desk has the keyboard ""drawer"" that pulls out and only has 3 inches between the drawer top and the desk bottom.  It had a strip of wood on the front face as a hand rest, that I had to remove in order to use this keyboard.  This keyboard has a hand rest of its own.  I'm only mentioning this because it is a common design on some computer desks and may not be as easily removable as mine was.  It needed to be removed because it set the keyboard too far back and the drawer was not opening far enough for the top keys to be accessed.  Also, since my keyboard drawer is only 29 inches wide, I only had 10 inches left for my mouse pad.  What I find is that the keyboard occassionally jostles my 8-3/4 inch wide mousepad and it jams against the side of the drawer making it hard to move.My set up works okay for me, however, if your keyboard drawer is any smaller and you need a larger area for a mouse, you might have a problem with this keyboard.The main advantages of this keyboard in my opinion is the sloped design that ergonomically suits the hands better and the USB ports.  As a person that has a digital camera, I find these USB ports very handy.  Who wants to fish behind your CPU every time, you want to download pictures.This keyboard also has keys at the top of it, that do some functions automatically, such as Mail, Calculator and My computer which are far to the right over the number keys.  Additionally, you can do all internet functions from Back,  to Home via keys on this keyboard (top left over keyboard).  I don't find the internet keys so handy as I tend to use the mouse for this.  (Habit from my work keyboard).  You also can bring up and control your media player via keys too (top right over keyboard).  This is handy.  You can adjust volume, play, stop or change to previous and next track.  This is neat, as you don't have to hunt around for this, while in the middle of something else.Also, handy are the indicator lights that show that the num lock, caps lock and scroll lock is on.  They are right in the middle of the keyboard where you can't miss them.  For someone that goofs with caps lock on passwords, this helps somewhat.  Ironically, due to my work keyboard though I find myself always looking in the wrong spot.As for installing this keyboard it was simple.  One thing I did find was that on my older 300 Dell machine, with Windows 98, I could not get the USB ports to work. I have no idea whether this was a factor of the computer or the keyboard.  However, now I have a 733 Windows ME and they work fine.  I have no idea why this happened.  I regularly have a USB CD writer attached to one and a digital camera to the other.This is a decent deal too.  I bought this keyboard for almost twice as much and find it an excellent investment.UPDATE: I just realized I did this review 9 years ago almost 10 and I'm typing this update on this very keyboard.  Sounds like it was a good investment after all.,

69,"I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.,
","My RP-HT21 headphones came in today's mail and I've been listening to it for the past hour with a smile on my face.  Is it possible that such low-cost headphones can produce such a full, realistic sound?  The answer is YES!  I've been looking for some new headphones to replace the stock earbuds on my SanDisk Clip Zip, not because the earbuds sound bad - they produce a very good sound - but because I found them to be uncomfortable.  I was told that a certain brand of earbuds were comfortable and sounded very good, so I bought them and was very disappointed in the sound, especially the booming bass.  As I mainly listen to classical music I wanted something well balanced, not bass heavy.  I noticed that over 430 people reviewed the RP-HT21 headphones and gave it a great overall rating.  I decided to take a chance on it and I'm very glad I did.  Not only does it sound terrific on soft and loud passages (and I like my classical music loud) but it's very comfortable as well.  I'm sure there are lightweight headphones available that have better sound quality, but not at anywhere near the price of the RP-HT21's.  This is an incredible buy.,
","I spent a fair amount of dithering before I bought this keyboard.  Not that it's excessively expensive.  Rather, it looked a bit of an ugly duckling up there on the shelf and I wasn't sure if it would be comfortable enough.On my third trip to the shelf, I finally studied it a bit more carefully.  I noticed the little messages on the keys to remind my failing mind of control functions.  I noticed the special function keys that provided web navigation, media control, instant access to My Computer and the calculator, and the sleep key.  I noticed the volume control keys.  I remember that I hadstarted to turn off the sound on my Klisch 4.1's because their volume occasionally gave the cats heart attacks.I figured, &quot;What the heck, I've made dumber mistakes&quot; and brought one home.  I already had an old, grungy Intellipoint keyboard, so intallation took about 30 seconds of hardware time and a minute to install the software.  &quot;So far so good&quot; I say to myself.  One star for installation.Test one: typing.  Ooh the extra large wrist rest that looked so ugly in the store looks pretty good.  And the angle feels a bit better.  The keys have a nice thunk and a springy feel.  One star for feel.Next I try the volume control - Wow! The look of worry vanishes from the cat's faces.  The rest of the media keys work fine and the internet navigators are great.  When I hit the sleep button my machine does exactly that.  One star for cool features.The software is simplicity itself.  Adjustments for speed, language, hotkeys, some special options and a nifty little on screen display for keys like volume.  Everything works just great!  One star for easy of use and clear instructions.The last star is for the two USB ports on the back of the keyboard.  This basically changes one of the USB ports from the back of my machine into two on my desk.  Works great for a mouse and, in my case, a zip drive.I've gotten used to the original funny shaped Intellitype.  This new model seems like the perfect set of improvements in functionality and ergonomics.  Given the amount of time I spend with my fingers on the keyboard it's well worth the money.,
"
70,"First let me qualify my comments.  If you are looking for an all purpose ePad or IPAD alternative, buy another product!  That's clearly not what Barnes and Noble designed this unit for.  It's not intended to surf the web, check email, etc.  It is an eReader...PERIOD!Having said that, in my opinion, it is the best out there right now.  It is incredibly light weight - much lighter than even a typical paperback.  It is easy on the eyes for extended reading periods and can be read in basically every lighting situation you could read a real book.  The clarity is sharp but not overpowering on the eyes like an LCD type display is after a few hours.The battery life is insane.  If you turn off WIFI, which should be normal unless you are looking for another book, the battery doesn't need recharging for weeks on end.  Page turning is a simple touch to the left or right of the screen.  Assignable buttons are also provided for pagination but they require a rather firm press.  I found most of the time I don't use them.It has a very responsive touch screen for all your navigation.  I had a 1st generation Nook and this one is far easier to navigate through books which is a big plus for Bibles or Reference books.  It reads ePub format so more than half of what I read comes from the public library.It is not going to be great for color magazines and so on.  You will need a Nook Color or an ePad like Xoom or IPAD for that.  But the downside with those is that the LCD type display cannot be read in direct sunlight so good luck at the beach or pool.One nice feature I use now and then is the dictionary.  If you come across a word you are unfamiliar with you just touch it and up pops an option look it up.  I think Barnes and Noble has a winner here.,
","I was looking to purchase a few low cost headphones for computer use in my house with 2 children.  I chose the over the ear type instead of buds because we were losing buds at the rate of 2 or 3 a week (seriously) between our house and our mini-van A/V setup. I figured over the ear headphones would be harder to lose for the kids and easier for me to find since 1) they were bigger and 2) the kids did not want to be seen outside the house with these :-). Also, losing headphones at this price point versus $20 ear buds is a little more tolerable.Simply stated, for the price point, they cannot be beat.  Build quality was not bad at all and I would classify them as durable.  In fact, on the two sets I purchased, I found it to be better than expected. In terms of design, I think the best word to describe it could be: utilitarian.  The headphones are very light weight. We found the cord more than long enough to plug into the headphone port of our monitors or laptops.  BUT, if you need to run the cord a long length, like to the back to a CPU under the desk, you will need a simple extension such asStereo Headphone Extension 12 feet 3.5mm.  The over the ear padding was more than sufficient for its purpose in my opinion. However, other reviewers have remarked otherwise. The headphones are adjustable enough that they fit a wide range of heads in my house from mine, to both my 6 and 12 year old.Sound quality is OK.  That's about it. However, that was all I was looking for.  For serious sound, my children and I rely on better quality ear buds anywhere from the $8 to $35 range.For the right purpose, you will not be disappointed in these headphones.,
","After reading about Tivo and personal digital recorders in magazine reviews and here, I decided I would take the plunge.  I thought hard about getting the Phillips 60 hour version, but at twice the cost and because I hadn't even tried the concept out, I decided to settle for the Phillips 30 hour unit.  After an easy, but time consuming setup (best if you do it right before bedtime), I quickly realized how cool and useful this thing is.  The video quality is fine, decent even at the &quot;lesser&quot; levels (movie credits do get blurry and difficult to read), although true videophiles may find it unexceptional.  I would have to say the most pleasing aspect of this is that I am now getting the most out of my premium cable movie channels.  I am now catching a lot of movies I routinely missed because I was not vigilant enough to find out when they might be on so that I could set my VCR to tape them.  Now, the &quot;Network Showcase&quot; feature alerts me to all of the channels' current and upcoming flicks and all I have to do is to say &quot;yea&quot; or &quot;nay&quot; to recording them.  Even if I don't check ahead, the thing records movies it thinks I might like based upon preferences I have expressed for other features and shows.  Awesome.  Also, skipping commercials is an easy and pleasurable feature.  By the way, any football (or other live action sports) enthusiast easily will see the usefulness of such a device.One thing that disturbs me about the Tivo phenomena is that I fear that it may be rendered obsolete quickly because of how rapidly technology is evolving.  I purchased the lifetime service option and I will be downright bummed if something else comes along to supplant it before I get my money's worth and I wind up having to buy into something else!,
"
71,"I'll make it simple. I loved my NOOK. I bring to school every single day and have sixty-plus books on there. It's great because it's light, it's portable(it fits in my pocket!), and most importantly, it has all my books at once. It can most definitely be read in direct sun, and I was pleasantly surprised that Barnes and Noble did not lie in the slightest when they advertised no glare. You can side load any pdf or epub file, as well as downloading books from the store. The book management is simply fantastic. The reading quality is also great because you can change font size as well as the font itself.However, on day I picked it up and I couldn't unlock it. I wasn't very worried, because the NOOK occasionally doesn't respond to touch because the infared sensors are blocked by dust and dirt. But it still wouldn't respond after cleaning it as well as five hard reboots, which were the only thing the BN support line could offer. I feel dissapointed but ordered the new Glowlight and hope that it will last longer, because it was just great while it lasted. I hope you have a better experience with your NOOK- if, that is, you decide to buy this older model.,
","Either I just lucked out and got a super copy of this lens or a lot of people just hate this lens because they feel they SHOULD as it was a Canon bundled kit lens some time ago and there are just oodles of them out there because frankly, this little lens is pretty great.  I read the other reviews of this lens and picked it up used for under $40 USD (delivered) in July 2013.  The lens focuses SUPER (amazingly) fast and very quietly on all my Rebel cameras (t5i, t4i, t3i, etc. [all my Rebel gear is APS-C]).  Used in aperture priority mode, this lens really SHINES.  Set it at f11 and forget it or open it wide up on a tripod or monopod and play around - the results are super sharp (and surprisingly so) for the price.  Compared to L glass, the color is not as vibrant on my copy especially leaning red and the contrast in low light is funky on this lens, but sometimes funky can be good (almost arty)! Play around and have fun!  Great lens to play with for VERY little money, and a real GEM at f11. Buy it for less than $40 and you can't go wrong!,
","Late this summer, I was driving a rented minivan from Mendocino, CA, south to the Bay area. It's about 180 miles. I was with three other adults and three children. Instead of taking the recommended RT 128 southeast to RT 101 and south to the Bay area, we decided to take a ""shorter"" route, due east on Lake Road to RT 20 to RT 101, then south. Well, the road we chose went through deep redwood forests. More often then not, we could not see the sky. There were times when the road was no longer paved, at times rutted. It was so narrow that for most of the way it would have been impossible for two vehicles to pass (fortunately, no vehicles came our way). The road often snaked around tree trunks as large as 10 feet in diameter.This road was on both our AAA map and GPS (I had preloaded the corresponding map onto my 64mb data card from the MetroGuide CD). The going was very slow, and our ""shorter"" route soon became the ""longer"" route. We were too far along to turn around. My wife, seated in the back held the portable phone ready to call for assistance. I asked all to wait, to put her trust in the GPS. After another half hour, we came to a three-road junction--all narrow and un-maintained. One of the roads was not on the AAA map. Intuitively, it looked like the least likely road. But the GPS indicated this road would take us to the RT 20. We took it, and before you knew it, arrived at the conventional RT 20. The GPS saved the day.One of the greatest attributes of a GPS is that it allows you to explore, to go where you normally would not, and discover new vistas. Obviously, my eMap proved that.Besides this general function, there are several specific features I like about the eMap. These include its portability and its ergonomic design. The eMap has a relatively large display (which can be backlit) and it is light, just over 6 oz. When walking with this unit in a town or on a trail, I appreciate being able to hold and control the unit with one hand while always having the display in view. This is a result of the control buttons being below the screen.The eMap is compatible with Garmin's downloadable MapSource CDs. These include U.S. Roads and Recreation, WorldMap, U.S. Topo, and MetroGuide U.S.A. With the MapGuide U.S.A. CD, the eMap can look up addresses and telephone numbers for nearby services and points of interest. I like being able find a particular restaurant or street address by entering it under the find feature, then tracking it. An arrow will point in the right direction and distance will be displayed.There are many available accessories, several which I recommend. I needed a larger data card. The unit comes with an 8mb card which will give you one region. This is okay if you will be using it in a limited radius. If you go elsewhere, you'll need to load new data using a serial cable (another accessory). It is time consuming, which may suggest your getting another accessory, the Garmin's USB data programmer. I have a 64mb card which captures from Massachusetts to Maryland (8 regions). Using the serial cable took over two hours to load the data. Using the programmer took about four minutes.I definitely recommend this unit. Its portability, versatility, its adjustable detail, and its accuracy give you the confidence to venture places without getting lost. One suggestion though--don't give up the paper map. Use it to provide the fuller perspective a portable GPS lacks.,
"
72,"I have had my nook simple touch for a few weeks now- I previously owned a Sony Reader pocket edition, and I own a iPad. This device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things, get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire. This device is designed to read books, and it does a beautiful job at it. I purchased my Sony reader expecting to be able to add comments in it, but it was way too difficult, and ultimately I decided to purchase an iPad. Like the Sony reader, the nook can take notes but wouldn't be a great device to purchase for that purpose.It was pretty easy to set up- I didn't read the instruction manual, but I usually don't. I just followed the on screen instructions to connect it with my internet, my barnes and noble account, and then plugged it into my computer to sync it with library books. I had a bit of trouble connecting it with my internet, but that has happened with every new device I've purchased, so I think its my internet's fault, not the nook. I went through the steps a few times and then it started worked.I really like holding it to read- I generally read ridiculously thick books, so its nice to have something small and light to hold instead of a massive book that I have to prop up (and its so much nicer to read from than an iPad- the iPad is fine to read from, and i never seemed to feel screen fatigue, but it is way too heavy to hold with one hand). Initially I didn't realize that the two buttons on either side of the screen move the page forward or back, so I was touching the screen each time- the delay time is a bit longer that way, and it was annoying to have to use both hands. As soon as I realized that the buttons existed, the experience got even better.The battery life seems great- I charged it all the way up using my usb-to-outlet power adapter that I have for my iphone/ipad, and it worked great. I haven't had to charge it again, and I've been reading for about an hour each day.The one thing that surprised me and was frustrating for a few minutes was when I realized that I couldn't load my other epub books onto the nook because there wasn't enough room. The advertised size of the nook is 2gb, which is a ton of books, but it wasn't enough room for the books I've acquired through other sources- like google book downloads. A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble. Fortunately there is an easy solution- there is a slot for a microSD card, and I happened to have a 2gb one lying around- plus they only cost about $5, if that. I popped it in, turned the device off and on, and I was ready to go again. Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.Kindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources. Yes, its possible to convert epub to kindle format but its an extra step that many people won't be interested in. I would have purchased the kindle with special offers, and hadn't thought much about it, but I've enjoyed the pictures of authors that show up on my nook screen, and would probably get annoyed by the commercials/make a point to put my nook in a case so I didn't have to see them.Durability- I haven't abused it by any stretch of the imagination- yet- but it did take a fall off a coffee table and didn't crack/break/show any sort of damageI'll update my review as I have more time to play with it in the next few months,
","Bottom line up front:  A very good, if underrated, telephoto zoom lens.  Highly recommended for beginner to intermediate photographers.  Best choice for the second lens you purchase.The Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III USM should be a strong contender for the second lens you own for your Canon DSLR camera.  Your first lens was probably a kit lens, typically a standard zoom lens that has a range starting around 20mm and goes to around 80mm, give or take a bit.  You've enjoyed that lens, but you're looking for something else...something with more distance, something you can really zoom in to see the action.  You want a telephoto lens.  (You're also probably wanting a wide angle zoom lens, something that will pull in that grand vista in front of you...that's a different review, but also a good choice for a second or third lens).So you start looking at all the different lenses out there, trying to find the best one for your money so you can take those photos you've been dreaming of taking.  But it gets confusing.  So many numbers.  You're just starting out, and you're wanting to make art, not do math problems!  And so many different opinions!  What is best?So here's my two cents.  It's biased, like everyone else's opinions here, but I'll try to tell you what I'm thinking and why.First, pick a lens that goes with your camera.  If you own a Canon camera, in the long run you'll be happier with Canon lenses.  I've owned a few other brands for my Canon cameras, but they've sometimes disappointed me.  Canon lenses usually don't.  There are several reasons for this, but the most practical is that your camera is a system.  The Canon camera &#34;talks&#34; electronically to the Canon lens and the Canon flash best, so if you're using *any* automatic settings, you'll get the best results using Canon products.  You *can* get just as good of photos using different lenses and different flashes...but you have to do all the work of communicating with the system by using manual settings.  Not a problem if you know what you're doing, but if you're new...you'll want to use Canon products to help with the workload and learning curve.  Even if you're experienced, it just makes everything significantly easier.  So, I'm biased there, but you at least know where I'm coming from.  My wife calls it &#34;lazy,&#34; I prefer to call it &#34;efficient.&#34;Next you need to think about what you want to do with the lens.  Since you're looking at this lens, you're probably thinking you want something that will give you the ability to take photos of things far away, or at least make something that looks small look a lot bigger in your photo.  A telephoto lens will do this.  For me, at least, this was the perfect second lens option.  Getting futher away from things usually was easier than getting closer, especially with wildlife.  So what kind of telephoto do you need?  For most folks starting out, a zoom telephoto (as opposed to a prime focus telephoto) is a better option...it allows you to zoom in and out, and better frame the photo you'll take.  So you'll be looking for a lens that shows a range of focal lengths (say, picking some random numbers....75mm-300mm).  The trade-off is that you'll have larger focal ratio (f-stop, f-number...it's called lots of things), which means you'll need longer shutter speeds but that's going to hold true for all zooms.  Image stablization will help with that some, but in practice if you're using bright light (like sunlight) I haven't found it makes that much difference and it costs significantly more.So that brings us to this lens.  It's an inexpensive telephoto zoom lens compared to other lenses out there.  It's no frills, and does the job.  It's also more light weight than most telephoto zoom lenses out there, which helps when you're holding the lens and camera by hand (remember, higher focal ratios mean longer shutter speeds...meaning you have to be more steady for longer).  Yes, there are &#34;better&#34; telephoto lenses out there...but you'll pay more for them.  And the big secret?  You'll not get that much better photos.  Don't get me wrong, I have some &#34;L&#34; lenses as well, and they're wonderful...but I don't necessarily get better photos from them.  I've had the Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III USM lens for almost 20 years, and I've taken some amazing photos with this lens.  Why?  Because I take a lot of photos, so I have a lot of practice with it.  It also helps having steady hands (although being a doctor and an expert military marksman means I have some practice there) and/or a tripod, but really there is no substitue for practice.  That goes for any lens, but if you're new to SLR photography, a good inexpensive lens like this to practice with will more than pay for itself.Telephoto lens.  Light weight.  Inexpensive.  Good quality.  You can ask for more, but you'll pay for it.  This one does the trick and works well.  Great to start with, and the skills you'll develop will translate when (if ever) you upgrade.,
","I just had a comment to make about the internal lithium-ion battery.I've had my IIIc for almost 18 months, which I've heard is about the life expectancy of the battery. Since it costs 1/4 to 1/3 of the purchase price of the unit to get the battery replaced, you need to factor that in to the long-term costs for the device.I still prefer the internal battery on the IIIc and the Vx to the replaceable AA batteries on the Handspring. Two other people I know have them, and at least once they've forgotten to change the batteries on their Handsprings, and they lost all their data and had to do a Hot Sync to restore it all.With the IIIc, I usually just charge it up every night so I've never lost any data. Also, a couple of times I tried running the battery all the way down until the unit won't even power on at all, to see if it would preserve the information in RAM even if there wasn't enough power to turn on the screen.That's exactly what happened. After the IIIc had recharged for about 20 minutes in the cradle, I could then turn it on, and all the data was still there. So even if it goes totally dead, if you get it on recharge right away, you should be okay. I don't know how much time you get, but I think mine was dead for at least several hours before I noticed it and stuck it in the cradle.So far my battery still works okay but it is showing some signs of aging, and I may need to replace it soon. After recharging it a few times, it refuses to charge past 65% of full, and to fix this I have to discharge it all the way, usually a couple of times, to get it to back up to 100% again.I've read that the best way to handle the battery recharges is to not discharge it completely all the time, as that is hard on the battery. You should just charge it up every day, and then about once a month discharge it all the way. Otherwise you start having the recharge problem I mentioned earlier. Still, I figure mine is still usable for another 6 months the way it is, even if it doesn't recharge all the way.,
"
73,"I bought this to replace a Sony PRS-300 that I thought was too heavy and too slow in the page turning.  Yes, the nook is quicker on the page turning and lighter but I am having too much trouble to appreciate faster and lighter.  I am having an infinite amount of trouble getting library books onto the nook - I've yet to succeed and the problems lie with adobe digital editions.  Why aren't nooks plug and play?  That's my first big problem.  I have no problem with my Sony and the library book I wanted is now on my Sony.  The second is that I like to read while I'm eating my lunch - ereader in left hand and fork in right.  It is not easy to change the page on the nook while eating - the bottom right corner is too far from my thumb and the bottom buttons are too high up the side.  The Sony has a set of buttons right in the bottom center, which is perfect placement.  I read the great reviews on the nook and for the price, I thought it was worth a try.  I'm also disappointed with the wifi registration requirement and wifi in general.  I don't need wifi on my ereader but it looks like they're all offering it now.  I also don't appreciate my registration info being used by B&N; as permission to start emailing me crap - I am already unsubscribed from that 'service'.  I'm definitely not happy with the nook and I'm going to save up my money to buy another Sony.**UPDATE 5/25/13**  I finally was able to download library books onto my nook but it was frustrating and time consuming; I finally found help online.  I have yet to discover a way to comfortably hold this book in my left hand and turn the page.  This was a very bad buy for me.  I bought a book-style cover for it and that was a waste of money as well as I find the cover just gets in the way.  I did not know how good I had it with the Sony PRS-300 and will continue to use my Sony instead of the nook.  I don't recommend the nook at all.,
","I was very disappointed in the reviews, and I had decided not to purchase this lens, but then I read the review by John Nolley II.  After reading his review, I purchased it.  I have had it for a few days now, and I am very happy with it.  I have not found any focus problems.  It acts exactly like my Canon 55-250mm Telephoto lens.  Most of my shots (about 99%) are Nature and Landscape.  Every now and then I photograph my grandchildren playing sports.  My first test of the lens was shooting birds in my backyard.  They do not sit still very long, so I was constantly focusing and refocusing, and it was fast enough for me.  I see no difference at all with the operation of this lens and my Canon 55-250mm.  The only thing it does lack is Image Stabilization.  I found myself turning the Image Stabilized button off for most shots with my 55-250mm, and I always use a tripod anyway, so it is not needed for me.Thank you John, I would not have purchased this lens had it not been for your review.By the way, I was able to sell my used 55-250mm on ebay for $107 minus $9 shipping & insurance costs (sold in a few hours), so I figure this lens cost me about $30.oo Net!I absolutely love this lens.,
","I've had these Bushnell Powerview 12x32 folding roof prism binoculars about 4 weeks.  After working out the best way to hold & adjust them to my eyes and after getting used to them, I found them easy to adjust, easy & smooth to focus, clear and conveniently compact.The binoculars are inexpensive, quick to grab, easy to use and reasonably clear & effective.  I use these for quick looks out the kitchen window at birds in nearby trees. . .short dogwoods.  They work well for that purpose (I'm not looking up into 80 foot pines with these).  I'm anxious to see how they perform out on broad water in a kayak for more distant viewing.I think I prefer the larger objectives in this compact folding roof prism style binocular (where the objective is 32 part of 12x32 or 16x32). I haven't tried the smaller objective Bushnell roof prism binoculars in this Powerview model but I never have been satisfied with similar smaller binoculars in other brands.An important consideration is the size of the image presented by the binoculars to the pupil...which is determined by dividing the objective lens size by the power, such as 32 divided by 12.  I don't want to go and get all the proper terminology but in general, the smaller the binocular's value of that ratio is in relation to the user's pupil size at the time, the less satisfactory the viewing experience is.  That's probably why I'm not happy with the smaller objective lens sizes in a binocular...the image presented to my eye probably is much smaller than my pupil -- You wind up having to hunt for the image in the eyepiece a lot.Anyways, the only thing I don't like about this folding compact style is the double hinge they all have.  When using them I sense they are folded unevenly and cock-eyed which bothers me...I like to have just a single hinge.  But then, these are ""Compact Folding"" BECAUSE of the double hinge and even if they are uneven it shouldn't affect the viewing.,

74,"This is the third ebook reader I've used and definitely the best.  The Franklin eBookman had nice hardware but dreadful firmware with more bugs than you would find in a swamp in summer.  The Ectaco Jetbook Lite had a number of glitches in its firmware as well, plus an extremely user-unfriendly upgrade method.I did encounter one major problem with this Nook Simple Touch -- the life of a battery charge was nowhere near the several weeks promised (with wifi off).  Fortunately, however, I called B&N; Customer Service, and they advised me to install the latest firmware, V1.0.1, which addresses the power issue.The upgrade proceeded easily and without glitches, and it seems to have solved the problem; though I haven't put the duration of a battery charge to the full test yet, the charge indicator is holding at 100% after a full day, including more than an hour of reading.  That compares very favorably to the 83% discharge rate I had been experiencing in just three days using the old firmware.  I will report back if the battery problem returns.Otherwise I prefer the Nook Simple Touch's ergonomics to the comparable Kindle.  The Nook's front is all screen, with no unnecessary keyboard keys.  Virtual keyboard keys appear onscreen when you need to search for something.  The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.There are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.  You have a choice of font styles and sizes, and the screen is easy to read even under bright sunlight.  You can touch any word onscreen to get a quick dictionary definition (provided, I found, that the word isn't hyphenated and run on two lines).I like the ease with which you can download titles from the public library (you download to Adobe Digital Reader, which your library provides free, and then transfer the Epub books to your Nook with the USB cable provided).  The program recognized my Nook without any glitches.I also like being able to read any book for an hour a day FREE at the nearby B&N; store.Newbies should note that, in their apparent effort to keep the NST instructions short and simple, B&N; left out a few useful ones.  Notably: to close one book (so you can open another), press the Nook button below the screen (the thing that looks like an upside-down U) and enter ""library.""  To lock the Nook immediately, without waiting for it to enter sleep mode, press the power button on the back briefly.  And to tell when the Nook has finished charging, wait for the little LED next to the USB input on the unit to turn from amber to green.So if you have been looking for an ebook reader offering great value and ergonomics, take a look at this Nook.  But make sure to upgrade to firmware V1.0.1 or higher!)UPDATE: Trust me to find the bugs in an ebook reader -- or perhaps they find me.  At any rate, I bought a copy of the American Heart Association Cookbook (7th Edition) and was dismayed to see some of the fractions describing quantities in recipes replaced by question marks!I emailed B&N; Customer Support, and they suggested that I try downloading the title again (which you do by archiving and unarchiving a title, whatever that means).  That didn't work, but I found that if I clicked the check box on the font selection screen marked ""Publisher's Default"" (or words to that effect), that seemed to solve the problem.  So if you're seeing question marks in any titles where numbers should be, try that solution!I sure love beta testing new products for these big companies -- NOT!,
","Just received the bins last night. I carefully opened the box and it was packaged very well. Kudos to the Canon Team! I was expecting a brick and it would weight a thousand pounds but based on the 12x36 I picked up in Las Vegas last week I knew it wasn't going to be an issue for me. I'm a big guy but not like Arnold and thought it was pleasant weight-wise. I actually thought it was light which could be a first! I thought I would try my rechargeable's at first and was disappointed that they didn't have enough charge. I tested the rest of my batteries and found a few that had a bit more charge. Unfortunately the Canon wanted even more charge as they only lasted 10 seconds so I broke out the batteries that came with the bins. They are 'not for resale' Panasonic alkalines. The 'lock' sound of the IS was much reduced with new batteries and the IS kicked in within a second or two max. Since it was night I pointed the bins to the sky and started to look around. Stars that you couldn't see with the naked eye magically appeared in the bins. It was stunning. And bright stars to the eye really popped in the bins making the 15x worth it and the brightness of the 50mm objectives definitely appreciated. The IS really really helps as the stars were shooting all over the FOV. It wasn't perfect but the shake was greatly reduced. The focus knob was perfect and it was easy to find the sweet spot. The pupil distance function was very easy to do too though it is different than other bins I've used. No issue there either. I actually like the eye cups and thought it would initially be an issue. I was happy this wasn't going to be an issue for my eyes (no glasses). I kept them extended and didn't roll them down. The front plastic caps fit as well as could be expected. I purchased the Canon objective plastic covers and they fit well. No issue there. I am giving this initial review a 4-star but after review of the bins during the day and I get better familiarity with the IS function with the batteries it may change (probably go up). I consider a 4-star very good only after using them for around an hour but only 15 minutes outside looking up in the sky.,
","/me sighs:  finally, I got good interwebz again.  Having two computers, and a neighbor with shoddy wifi, I could only get a good connection on one computer.  I got tired of this, so I ordered this, with which I have had great experience in the past, previously owning about 4 of these.  I use a lot of BitTorrent traffic, downloading and uploading different -nix distros and other FOSS and CC files, and every other router I've ever tried crapped out on me after about 5 minutes of BT traffic.  The BEFSR41 is my personal favorite, and am glad to have gotten it at a decent price here.  I definitely recommend this router.  I got this one refurbished, and there's nothing wrong with it at all, save for some minor issues setting it up.  UPnP port forwarding is one of its features I'm glad to have, uTorrent showed all green for connections.  I have not noticed any drop in network speed, like with a few other routers.  Easy install, good features, reliable performance, durable case, nice-looking case, overall A+ in my book.EDIT:  Okay, I'm sad to say that I've gotta change my review here to one of negativity.  I have been suffering from a broken GUI within the router (at 192.168.1.1).  The router does not accept UPnP, even though I've managed to set it to accept UPnP.  When I fire up uTorrent, my mIRC connection drops, and my web connection drops to about 300kbps dl speed;  after much frustration, and even a firmware upgrade, I have decided to give up on trying to make it work.  Soon as I save up some money, I'll be buying a brand-new router, and will likely hang this router in front of my archery target.The only reason I'm still giving the router 2 stars instead of 1 is, first, the one I have is refurbished, and the NIB ones I owned in the past didn't suffer these problems, and second, because my problems might be isolated to just my router, not all refurb's.,

75,"I don't read a ton so I didn't want to pay a huge premium for an e-reader.  I have an iPad but when I do read, sometimes staring at that screen for more than an hour can give me a headache.  It came down to this, the basic Kindle, and the new Kindle Paperwhite.  When I really thought about it, the Paperwhite was more than I really wanted to spend on something I would only use an hour or 2 a week.  I ultimately decided to get this because it could read epub files natively and didn't have to be converted to MOBI files which the Kindle uses.It wasn't quite as straight forward as I was expecting.  I initially thought it'd be like the iPad where you just drag the book into the Books section of iTunes and you're ready to go.  I dragged the books onto the Nook when it appeared on my desktop and nothing happened.  I found out you had to download ADE and set it up that way.  From there you have to add the books to ADE then add them to your Nook, not a huge deal, but a few extra steps compared to the iPad.I also noticed that scrolling between pages had a bit of delay compared to the iPad and that when you were trying to use the scroll bar to advance more than a few pages at a time, it wasn't the most accurate.  It also appears that page sync only works with content you purchase from them and not files you have already on your computer(I think the Kindle is the same way as well though).The reading experience is great though.  Its not too bright and easy on the eyes.  The Nook itself is pretty light so its not a hassle to hold it for awhile.  Library is also easy to scroll through once its on your device.Overall I am happy with it.  I mentioned its shortcomings, but they don't outweigh how easy it is to read and the overall reading experience.  From a reading standpoint I'd give it 5 stars, just some other things that popped up that aren't big deals, but noticable.  I'd recommend this to anyone like myself who doesn't do a ton of reading, but still wants a simple e-reader.  If you are a more serious reader, I'd probably spring for the Paperwhite.,
","I had a very hard time deciding on just what digital camera I was going to buy.  Should I get a 2.x megapixel cam  or should I spend a few extra bucks to get the C-3000 zoom, which happens to be the lowest priced 3.3 with the features that this camera has.  Well, obviously I chose the C-3000 and I could not have made a better decision.  All of the features and extras are just the beginning of this cameras greatness.  I was absolutely stunned by the incredible quality of the pictures that this camera produces.  With a good printer and some photo paper, you won't even notice the difference between homemade pictures and professionally developed film pictures.  Even large 8 X 10 pictures are crystal clear with this cam.  When you first use this cam, you may be confused by the many options you have, but after a day or two of playing around and reading the instruction book, you will be able to make the most out of every photo.  If you are one of those people who absolutely hate auto focus, don't worry.  It has it.  It also allows you to control aperture and shutter speed, allowing you to leave the shutter open for a full 16 seconds, allowing you to create amazing effects.  By the second night I had the cam, I produced a neat looking picture of a car with the appearance of the lights tailing behind it thanks to the control you have of shutter speed and flashing.  If you just want simplicity, the C-3000 can do that too.  If you are not into being in control of your photos, just point and click.  If you do not like your photo, you can immediately view and delete it to avoid wasted space.  I can't even estimate how much film I have lost because of bad pictures that I wish I could take back.  If scenery is your thing, then you will love the panoramic feature.  With the aid of a tripod, you can make full 360 degree panoramics.  You take each part of the panoramic individually with the aid of the veiwfinder, and the computer software will combine the pictures allowing you to create a true panoramic, not the fake kind found in Advanced Photo System cameras.  If taking a panoramic seems to complicated for you, then just switch it over to movie mode.  Depending on the memory you have, you can record anywhere from 30 second to 10 minute video clips, all with sound.  If I were to continue listing all of the features, my hands would fall off from typing too much.  Whether you are an avid photographer looking for complete control of every shot or a person looking for a simple digital cam that takes great pictures, this cam is perfect for you.  There is one question about this camera that I do not feel that I could answer.  What can't the C-3000 do???,
","I use this router to support my home network. It is connected to a Speedstream 5260 DSL Ethernet modem on the WAN side and 3 of my 4 computers are plugged into it. The uplink port is connected to a Netgear DS108 hub, to which my 4th computer and a NetGear PS110 print server are connected. Router performance is satisfactory at this time but I am only starting out with DSL.I buy Linksys and Netgear components which, for the most part, have performed well. There were some exceptions. I quickly realized that both companies have extremely poor technical support. Both companies refuse to support operating systems other than Windows (they must have a contract with Microsoft about that?), and putting in a support request of any sort will result in disappointment.So if you buy Linksys or Netgear components, remember you are on your own. Don't expect support. You will usually do better to thoroughly read the provided documentation, then coldly analyze whether your network falls within the parameters specified by that documentation and what you want it to do. If you don't understand this or that networking issue, then dig in and be prepared to learn about it -- elsewhere, on the internet -- and to experiment until you get things right. Search off usenet discussion groups for help. Always be aware that the component you buy may not be able to do what you imagine it should be doing. Always realize that networking components from these manufacturers are not going to work &quot;out of the box&quot; in your particular network configuration because there is always going to be some software configuration you will have to do. The stuff you have to do will influence component performance very heavily.I don't buy these brands because of a superior quality perception. In fact, I'm still feeling my way around networking hardware components and I'm not terribly skilled with the software side either. Both Linksys and Netgear share a monopoly on the consumer networking hardware market. Netgear and Linksys products take up most of the shelf space at your friendly CompUSA store.I'd like to say one more thing about product support in general. I'm always amazed at how people will intially send a 1 or 2 line support request, devoid of crucial details, and then become upset that their problem hasn't been immediately fixed. A tech support professional probably sees this type of initial support request 80% of the time. He or she is forced to ask questions before enough information is accumulated in order to solve the real problem. It is not his (or her) fault that the customer did little more than say &quot;I have a problem with your router. Fix it!&quot; Much more detail is needed for a technical solution.So if you put in a support request -- do yourself and the support technician a huge favor. First, carefully read the manual again to see if that helps. I promise that 85% of the time, you will find the answer to the easier problems. If you don't, take the time to carefully describe the problem and give a good background to it. Even then, do not expect stellar support from either Linksys or Netgear. But don't use this as your excuse to be a poor support customer. Help yourself and help them by doing your homework and providing important details.,

76,"I tried to leave this review at barnesandnoble.com, but they never posted it. Oh well.The Nook Simple Touch is a great e-reader. If you are looking for a tablet like device to surf the internet and check email, this is not the product for you. The e-ink screen is amazing. It looks like you are reading a physical book. I like that you can turn the page by pressing the buttons or touching the side of the screen. Either way will be useful depending on how you are holding the book. This is very simple, which I love. One night, I was lying down in bed and went to lay the Nook on it's side then immediately jerked it back up before the page orientation changed. Then I remembered that it won't do that; which makes this great for reading no matter what position you may be sitting or lying in.The Nook accepts epub books; which means that you can get books from a variety of stores, not just Barnes & Noble. I found that between the B&N; store and Google Books, you can get all of the classics for free. No reason to pay for one of those ever again. Download Adobe Digital Editions to put books on from other places; including borrowed books from the public library.The Nook doesn't handle pdf's well on its own, but there is a work around. Download Calibre, bring your pdf's into it and then convert them into epubs. Once you do that, you will be able to highlight and take notes like you can with the actual books.If you want a simple e-reader, the Nook Simple Touch is the best. (FYI: It's costs less on the B&N; website.),
","The Olympus C-3000 (now priced ...) is a wonderful buy. In its league it is by far the best digital camera. Its  got a resolution of 3.34 MP. Other camera's with the same resolution cost a lot more. This camera is easy to use, and prints wonderful pictures. I had an HP C315 xi and I was disappointed because the pictures looked grainy but  not in this one, the pics in this one are better than a  film camera. This camera also does MPEG movies with sound. I love that feature.It has pretty decent LCD. Watch out though, though ! If you buy this camera from not a reputed store, you might find a couple of dead pixels on your LCD screen. Buy it from a reputed store such as AMAZON or (...)so that you get value for your money.This camera comes with the cables that let you connect it to your television and view a slide show of all the pictures. It does not come with a carrying case. It comes with a remote control that allows you to be part of all the pictures you are taking (which is a good thing !).You can connect this camera to your USB port of your computer (make sure you've got a USB port in your pc and you've got Windows 95 b, otherwise this may not work for you.It comes with the Camedia Software which although not the best, will do okay.I recommend buying a memory card of atleast 64 MB. (Try (website) for a cheap card). This helps a lot. The card that comes with the computer is only 8 MB. You'll run out of this easily.There are other cameras which are very expensive and I do not recommend those. I think this camera is simply wonderful. One more thing, you will definitely need rechargeable NiMH batteries and a recharger, the batteries provided run out sooooooo easily.,
","Note to first reviewer - these headphones sound much better and go much louder when hooked up to a headphone amplifier, their primary intent was not to be run out of a regular headphone jack on a cd player or boom box.  The HD490's or 495s would sound a bit better and a lot louder on your boom  box, another good choice would be the Grado SR-60 for you.I have owned  my pair of HD500's for about 6 months now, and I have been very pleased  with them.  While not perfect, they sound much better then what you find in  most stores.These headphones are not bright at all but rather warm, and  have a very laid back sound.  They also tend to exagerate bass somewhat,  which leads to a slightly boomy sound which I do not care for very much.  (People who like loud bass read that last sentence as:  These headphones do  produce a lot of loud, deep bass, particularly when asked to do so)  Those  sound qualities make them good for electronic music, as they do not sound  edgy or harsh, and bass is plentiful. They are not fatiguing to listen to  at all, in part due to the laid back sound. (I have had them on for 5 hours  straight)They also have excellent sound qualities for computer games too.  Explosions have force, and imaging is very good too, so you will hear  everything from where it is supposed to be coming from.That said, these  are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn.  If you are more the  audiophile vareity I would personally reccomend the Sennheiser HD580s or  the 600s, they have a much more neutral sound that colors the music a lot  less.  They also absoluely require an amplifier to get decent sound out of  them.,
"
77,"Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of Amazon.com. In the past month alone, I have made at least 12 purchases.  I was browsing around just now and decided to see what Amazon.com customers thought of my newest electronic device.  I was thrilled to see the high rating, but disappointed to see the price; $40.00 more than the thing costs at B/N since its release last month.  Amazon, you need to do better here!Now to the product - This is my first e-reader and I am certain that I went with the best product for me.  As someone who buys a lot of books from Amazon, I would have preferred to have bought the Kindle,especially since Amazon has more of the types of books I read and for much cheaper than B/N, but I just do not appreciate those tiny buttons on the device.  I absolutely LOVE my Nook Simple Touch, and I use it for several hours every day.  B/N has Free Fridays - when you can download a featured book for free -, book share -with contacts on your device and social networks, and free reading of selected books when you are in B/N.  My understanding is that I can go to local libraries and even borrow my books using my Nook; This may or may not be any special news.The touch screen is a bit sensitive on the device, so if you prefer not to use it, they are also tactile ""buttons"" that will allow you to change pages.  The home screen shows the book you are currently reading and the page number you are on - a few other books in your library, and some suggested readings.  You can create shelves that you name on which to house your books by categories. They do not look like physical shelves, rather they are just a grouping of books.Without going into more technical stuff that you can read online, I will say that if you are new to e-reading and you enjoy touch screens -  AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS YOU TO READ - Do not hesitate to go into a B/N and try this out.  Some people buy this expecting it to browse the web (although it does have a hidden browser that the techies are working to hack) - Play their audio files, when there is not headphone jack (Techies have discovered that it DOES have built-in bluetooth, however), and folks buy this and complain that they do not like how it does not display their magazines in color.  It is not meant to do that - it is meant to be solely an enjoyable easy-to-use reading device that does not give you a whole lot of options to be distracted from the task at hand, READING!This is why I bought it - Eventually, I will get a nook color - or a Kindle *color* if they come out with one, but for now, I thoroughly  enjoy my Nook, which has encouraged me to slow down and spend so much more time in the peaceful, leisurely act of reading. In my excitement, I am reading like 8 different books at once.  That is the great joy of having an e-reader - speaking to those who are, just as I used to be, resistant to the e-reading craze - there is no more lugging around a bag filled with books, and when I get tired of reading one, another book is just a couple of swipes away. I am learning about how to get all sorts of books for free or low cost, as well as learning how to take advantage of conversion and e-book management tools such as Calibre.  I am having a blast with this thing!Yesterday, I received a nice leather case for it that I purchased off Ebay for a great price.  Once again, I looked to Amazon.com first, but there simply were not good options.  I got a black leather Caseen case that also came with a screen protector for twenty bucks.,
","ATTENTION BUSINESS TRAVELLERS: This unit works very well on an airplace service tray and folds up nicely when not in use. I hate bulky carry on bags and this combo can fit in your pockets!What else do I like about it?(1) Works perfect. Every time, no problems. Very reliable.(2) The keys feel good and it is easy to type fast.(3) Wow factor. This is an innovative device that expands whatyou can do with your Visor without comprimising portability.(4) Folds up nicely and tucks away in a sturdy outershell case.(5) Compatibility. This unit is compatible with every application I have I tried it with; games, business apps and word processors.The unit tri-folds and features an expanding keyboard track that allows you to click the keyboard into place once unfolded.It is easy to install. You load a driver onto your desktop, Hotsync it into your Visor and then connect the keyboard.There is a keyboard icon on your Visor that has an option to turn the keyboard on and off. At times I have had to reactivate the keyboard whenever I hook it up, but that only entails unchecking the activate box and then re-checking it.The keyboard has a slide out docking station that supports the visor from the back side.I bought my Visor to keep track of information and to access the web wirelessly. I quickly learned it was possible to access my spreadsheets and other Microsoft Office documents and be able to edit and save them on my Visor.That, of course, led to needing a keyboard. I am good at the graffiti, but nothing beats the keyboard when it comes to a lot of data entry. I now carry this combo wherever I might have brought a laptop and it works very well.,
","These headphones sound fabulous with most music. They are very uncolored and don't fatigue or rip your head off. The midrange is very smooth and silky and they image vocals well. They are also the most comfortable headphone I've ever worn. I listen to hard rock, jazz and classical and find all that music pleasing through them. I use them for listening to CDs and in my home studio.On the down side, as some people pointed out they are very inefficient and require a decent pre-amp to drive them. My Sony S2 Walkman can barely drive them so I use these with a Rotel stereo pre-amp or Mackie mixing board. They also distort if you drive them to moderately loud levels so if you like your rap music loud, these aren't for you.I demo'd these against several other Sennhieser models (560 & 580 I think) and 3 Grado models in the same store. I also listened to some Sony MDR-7506 and AKG K240S Studio in another store. I thought the Sony's were a decent pair of phones and so were the AKGs but I found these to be superior in terms of having a very natural and smooth sound. The Grado's ripped my head off because they have a very bright and forward sound.,
"
78,"I bought it and love it.The Good StuffThe UI is a lot better than the Kindle (I bought one for my brother, so I felt the difference between them), it's really confortable to hold and read, the touch is great for navigating between de UI, but the physical buttons are my choice, takes a little time to get used to it because they are not as sensitive as the Kindle ones (that are too sensitive, I mean the basic edition), but that's a good thing since I avoid turn pages accidentaly.The structure is lightweight and really confortable, unlike Kindle, the frame around the screen es wide enough to put my fingers on it to read (I have large hands), the grip is great thanks to the rubberized exterior. It's a pleasure to read on this thing.The Not so Good StuffNot sharing on sideloaded content. If I sideload a book from other store, the sharing option gets unavailable.Not that many formats. Just Pubs and PDF. I mostly read Pub files, but it would be great if they support other formats too.Not ""send to"" option. In kindle I fell in love with the option to push content to the device via wireless. This thing doesn't have a feature like that, so WiFi is not as usable as it is on the Kindle.Overall a great product, I liked it more than the Kindle mainly because is a lot more confortable to read, better ergonomics, and the UI makes it feel a lot better.,
","OK, in an attempt to find the ""perfect"" backpack, I ordered this one (LowePro Mini Trekker AW), the Tamrac Expedition 5 and the Kata R102.  I ran them through their paces and guess what I found?  None of them had everything I wanted.  That being said, I settled on the Lowepro.  Details below...BACKPACKS IN GENERALThe Bottom Line:Simply put, it seems that it's nearly impossible to find a backpack that combines comfort with capacity.  The Kata R102 was, by far, the most comfortable, study backpack of the 3 but was hands-down the ""smallest"" pack space-wise.  There was hardly any room for manuals (my D70 manual and SB600 flash manual bulged the one pocket) and very little storage for ""trinkets"" (it all fell loose).  The Lowepro and Tamrac packs had ample room, but were only semi-comfortable on my back compared to the Kata.  So I had to decide between capacity and comfort.  Since I really want a ""carry everything"" pack, the LowePro won out (being cheaper when compared to Tamrac and having a better ""fit"" on my back (6'4"")).THE LOWEPROThe Good:Of the three, only the LowePro was configured in a way that you could carry two ""ready"" cameras.  Of course all 3 would carry a second body and lens, but not ""assembled"".  The LowePro has room at the bottom for a second camera pointing toward the top of the pack.The LowePro has the best ""non-camera"" storage system, with a system of mini slots and pouches for things like PDAs, iPods, books, etc.  The Tamrac had this, but it was one big compartment where they would all jostle around.  The Kata's was non-existent (literally).The LowePro and Kata both have a true weather-proof cover but the LowePro stores it away in a built-in pouch in the bottom instead of taking up a ""lens slot"" (like the Kata, which is already space-limited).The LowePro is the cheapest of the three (always a plus)The Bad:Not much ""bad"" that I can see, aside from the fact that it's not THE most comfortable of the three, but it certainly beats out the Tamrac which was the least comfortable of the three (for me)The Ugly:Of the 3, the LowePro has, by far, the worst tripod carrying system.  Sure, the ""hideaway"" tripod puch is nice, but the supplied system of *elastic rope* is flimsy and seems to have been included as an after-thought.  The compression straps can be crossed and hooked to the ""wrong"" side as a fix, but one shouldn't need to ""fix"" anything at these prices...I decided on the Lowepro (as I said above) because I wanted a ""carry everything"" bag that would fit on my back.  What I get is a nice ""gadget bag"" that fits comfortably on my back for a run through the airport.  I do NOT have a backpack, however, that would work for a several-hour hike.  I have a pack that's good for the State Fair so I have what I need and my wife can fit a few things she picks up as well.  It will NOT be good for a day-trek through Paris.  Then again, if I'm hiking in the woods or sight-seeing through Paris, do I really want EVERYTHING camera-related on my back?  Probably not.  I'm more likely to carry a small sling/fanny-pack for the camera, a zoom lens and maybe a flash.When all was said and done, the LowePro struck the best balance of comfort and space.  Space management was best in the one and comfort was second only to the Kata (which I preferred most of the three but lost out because of severe space restrictions).Bottom line: You're not gonna be satisfied with what you get ;)  At this price range, none of the backpacks serve up everything (my Dad and brother, who are also amateur photogs agree).  The LowePro WILL, however, serve your immediate needs and save you a few bucks to investigate other options.  It's sturdy and wears well for short periods of time (maybe an hour or two tops) and will DEFINTELY carry everything you might for a two-camera system (assuming you can share secondary lenses between the two).Hope this helps!PS I have no clue why this pack is showing up as ""unavailable"" on Amazon at the moment.  Odd...,
","Well I've owned this one for a few years now and my eardrums have never really enjoyed it. I even have a headphone amp and took the earpads off to try and modify how it sounds. It really is too muddy sounding for my tastes. I don't understand why some people have reviewed it as having to much treble. I cant hardly hear any high frequencies and it only sounds somewhat decent if I use an equalizer. I do have to say though it is the most comfortable headphones I have ever owned. It is a joy to be able to wear this for hours on end with out a break. Although it has been built with mostly plastic it doesn't creak like some very cheap headphones do. Too bad it just doesn't sound very good. The bass for me sounds ok but the mids and highs sound dead. Even all my cheap Sony headphones sound much better.For the sound I would give 0 stars but for the comfort of wearing them I'd give a 5. Because sound is more important for me I gave 2 stars overall. I'm not sure if you can even buy this model anymore.I have since moved on to Grado headphones and the sound from them is much much more pleasing.,

79,"This is an update from my initial review.This Barnes & Noble Nook Simple Touch was advertised by BlueProton at Amazon as having been marked down from $249.99 to $68.99, so it certainly seemed like a great deal. It now seems like fraudulent advertising because I've since read that the MSRP is $79.99Initially I had serious problems with the Nook, and requested a refund. The seller, BlueProton, refused to take returns or give a refund for it, and directed me to Barnes & Noble who referred me back to the seller, stating  that the seller should refund it within 14 days; at that time  I'd only had it a few days. My Amazon A to Z claim ended with Amazon siding with the seller, BlueProton because their policy stated that they would not accept returns on Nooks - something I did not see when I initially read their policy!Because neither BlueProton nor Barnes & Noble would take responsibility for the defective product, and their attitude was ""Take the money and run!"", I'm giving the Nook a low review although later I found an update for the Nook which resolved the problems - with no help or information from either seller or Barnes & Noble!I now enjoy using the Nook which is so much easier and more comfortable to hold than regular books while reading,  and to carry back & forth to work each day or to travel with. I don't like the gray screen which requires you to face the Nook towards the light; and I don't like the glare on the screen from the sun or lights. I have to sit ""just so"" to read it - which somewhat defeats the idea of portability. Overall I do like it, but it needs improvement.My favorite use of the Nook is to borrow my local library's digital books using the free Overdrive Media Console software which allows you to select & save your library (ies) and to directly access the digital library from it on your PC, and then sideload (drag & drop)the borrowed books to your Nook; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse, borrow or return books downtown, and no more parking hassles! Most of my library's digital books are in ePub format which is the native format of the Nook. However, as other reviewers have stated, you can still borrow or buy Kindle or other formats of digital books and convert them to ePub via the free Calibre software. Borrowed library books can be returned automatically when the loan periods expire, or can be returned manually earlier if you decide not to finish the book during the loan period.Ordinarily I don't buy many fiction books because I rarely read any of them more than once. Additionally, due to the poor customer service from both Amazon (who owns Kindle) and Barnes & Noble (who owns Nook) I am determined to rarely buy any books from either of these companies, and will primarily download either their free books or the library's loan books. The companies want us to buy their ebooks, but won't take responsibility for their e-readers, so that infuriates me and alienates me for life.The pros: the low price; comfort; convenience; savings from being able to borrow library books instead of buying something you'll only read once; no clutter of physical books; easy loaning to friends with a guarantee that they will be returned in 14 days (automatic returns); ability to read multiple formats via conversion in free Calibre software. The Nook can also read your PDF files/documents from your PC or elsewhere, plus it can use your JPEG files of photos to use as your custom screensavers; the Nook will convert them to B&W.;The cons: PlueProton's and Barnes & Nobles's total lack of responsibility for their defective Nooks - why I gave the Nook such a low rating; Amazon's siding with Blue Proton's irresponsible returns policy; dreary gray screen which makes it difficult to read except in bright lighting; touch screen not as sensitive and responsive as it should be - often have to touch the screen a few times before getting a response.Over all I'm pleased with my Nook Simple Touch now that I managed to FIX IT BY MYSELF, but the companies' irresponsible policies have soured me towards them for life.,
","The Sony DSC-S50 may not be the cheapest digital camera you can buy, but it certainly has to be one of the best. The USB port makes loading your pictures on a computer really easy. The controls and menu layout are similar to the Mavica, so if you have used that camera then you already know how the menu system on this one works. The small size and storage capacity are what sold me on this camera. As noted in some other reviews, a viewfinder would be nice, because if you are taking pictures outside, it can be difficult at times to see the image on the flip-up screen. But those are about the only drawbacks to this camera I can think of. I have taken most of my pictures at the lowest resolution, and even then, they are still EXCELLENT pictures. I even posted a picture of a book cover on ebay, and you could read every word that was printed on the book cover. I used the Macro mode and it worked great. I have used a Kodak and Mavica (not owned) in the past, and found the Kodak to be OK, but it isn't in the same league with SONY. I also have to give AMAZON a plug here too. They gave me great service, shipping costs were reasonable, and you save at least $50 or so compared to a typical retailer. This camera comes with a 4mb Memory Stick and I bought a 16mb for additional storage capacity, and I would definitely recommend getting at least that. They are a little pricey right now, but I'm betting the price will drop in the future. Overall, this is a great camera and you won't be disappointed if you buy it. Don't waste your money on off-brands.,
","I am giving this product a 2 to balance the scales.  First I will say what I like about it... then the bad stuff. -  The good: MSOFT and HP are almost there, this is much more palm-esque than their last try.  You can choose to  use an application manager that feels just like the palm's, and you can  even beam contacts cross-platform (to a palm).  Also, you can get a special  ethernet card for the 545 to plug it in to a LAN for all your networking  desires. (though I haven't done this yet)But don't be fooled by some of  the reviews below- many of these people work for HP and microsoft (trust  me, I just know this), and are using the reviews to generate positive spin  on this product. The 545 is still definitely slower than the palm, and  definitely much bigger (than the palm V).  Also, check any PDA shareware  site- There are so many more free or cheap programs for the palm, so for  the people who wrote that their palm couldn't &quot;do enough&quot;, they  must not have even tried.If you're looking for an mp3 player, do you  really want one that shares your PDA's operating system?  (The mp3 player  software uses almost all of the processor's capacity just to play music.)  Also, the color is really nice looking inside, but harder to see in bright  light.  I guess the bottom line is also the bottom line-  Competitively, I  see this as Palm's equal, but financially, you'll be taking a bigger hit.  (Eventually, when someone like GoType makes an external keyboard for the  545, it could be a decent surrogate laptop.),

80,"I've used the Nook Touch and the Kindle Touch/Kindle Paperwhite extensively and the Nook is the best. Why? I'm convinced that if anyone prefers the Kindle its because they've never tried the Nook. Or they have friends that used Kindle and don't want to venture out on their own.First the Nook feels better. It has a soft plastic outside with a curved back that makes holding the device quite pleasant. It has just enough area around the screen that you can hold easily without mistakenly turning pages. And the side page turn buttons are deep enough you won't turn pages by accident. Some might not like it because you have to push pretty hard, but that's by design.Second the platform is user friendly and great to navigate.Third the font choices are better and you get several more to choose from. Plus the size options all make sense. For instance on the Kindle the couple smallest font sizes are so small I can't see why anyone would use them and to me it's a waste.Fourth the buttons are all well placed.Fifth there are no ads and you can even upload your own pictures.Go try one today. I'm fairly confident you'll love it.....unless you don't.,
","I'm just now writing this review after I bought this camera used on Ebay and years later.  I have nothing but great things to say about it...- It has held up through the worst abuse with me.  Even survived a few concrete drops.  Construction is awsome.- Optics are great.  I can get about 5in from an object before it gets blurry; and that is enough to get fine print off of something in great detail.  Zoom control is great once you get the hang of it.  Moving objects are usually no problem and you do not have to hold the camera extra-steady to aboid blurring either.- Colors are vibrant in most any light source.  I rarely have to mess with the brightness/contrast in PShop.  I don't know how, but image quality rivals 5 MP cameras that I've used.  I actually bought a Casio Exilim 5MP and resold it right away to stick with this.- Swivel LCD is useful for personal photos.  No dead pixels or problems with the LCD after years of USE!- Aftermarket batteries are $10 and work great.  Original used battery lasted 2 yrs.Might not be worth >$100 these days, but definitely close!  One thing's for sure, you definitely won't be the least dissapointed.,
","Ok, I had some savings in my pocket and I thought &quot;Hmmm...what should I buy?&quot; Voila! I decided to get an MP3 player...Rio600. Let's see what problems I've encountered with this nifty device:Battery Pack: On my first night with Rio, we started having problems. I had to figure out how to remove the battery/memory pack at the back of the unit. There was this little button that you press but nothing happens. To remove the battery pack, you got to pry and clamp your nails around the edges to slide off the cover. Taking it off was difficult, putting it back was almost impossible. You have to align the connector pins between the pack and the unit and at the same time putting it at an angle so you can slide the cover back on. Too cumbersome!!! Requires getting to used to.Power Guzzler: This baby drains your batteries like hot milk. My suggestion is you buy rechargeable batteries- Alkaline Rechargeables or Nickel Metal Hydride batteries. If you dont invest on rechargeables, you'll be making frequent trips to the corner store for batteries.Now it's on, now it's off: By some weird phenomenon, my Rio600 kept shutting itself off. One minute it's playing, the next minute the system just shuts down. I reboot the unit and nothing happens. I reboot it twice, three times, and then it boots itself. Hmmmm... Off I went to the store and had it replaced with a new one. Now I got a new but the assembly was not done properly on the unit. A small opening can be seen on the sides. Somehow, somebody from Diamond Rio fell asleep while putting my unit together. Off I went again and had it replaced. Now everything's working normally.The Software, oh the humanity: DiamondRio needs to release a more stable software. It's a bit too buggy. Most of the time, the software can't detect your USB connection to the unit. THe workaround is to go to the Options screen manually select the device connected to the USB. Also, there's a bug whereby if you delete some songs in your database, it still leaves the files in your hard drive. Weird really...Now the good points:WMA Files: It takes WMA files. Since it's only 32 mb, WMA can squeeze in more music into your player than mp3 at the expense of sound quality. WMA is Windows's answer to MP3. WMA usues 64kb as opposed to MP3's 128 kb.Sound Quality: Sound is pretty decent when you listen to WMA or MP3. However, with the WMA, the cymbals and high hats sound a bit wavy rather than a consistent hissing sound of a cymbal.Volume: This player packs a LOUD PUNCH. This is really loud. I'm using a Sony WEAR headphones and RIO600 just knocks your ear drums off. Not advisable to listen to full volume on extended periods. Too risky.Overall, the device is good except for a few quality control issues. It's a shame because on the memory pack, there's a label that says ASSEMBLED IN THE USA. If you're planning to get this unit, be prepared for some surprises like returning it and getting a new one. People have already complained about the poor quality control on this device. But that doesnt mean all the units are duds. Who knows, you might be lucky enough to pick a solid one. ANyways, the device is worth the money. It's light, it's cheap, it's a got a solid sound quality.,

81,"I know Amazon is going to hate me for this but here goes:I used to have a Kindle 3. It was great. It made reading a pleasure however there were a couple of things I would have liked to change. I wished that it had a touch screen and that it was smaller.When I saw the Nook Touch I thought that this is what my Kindle should be like. Well I decided to buy the Nook and I'm very, very pleased. I won't go into an in depth review of the device itself. You can find that just about anywhere. What I will say is the touch screen makes things so much easier. I love the on screen virtual keyboard (like the ipad) and the fact that it's a lot smaller than the Kindle 3 but with the same size and quality screen.Since giving the Kindle to a relative I thought about the books that I already bought from Amazon and the fact that I now have to use my Android phone to read them since the Nook does not read Kindle books......or does it??With a little research I was able to find out how to root my Nook Touch (voids your warranty). Now when I turn on the Nook, it gives me a dual boot screen (sort of). I can go to the Android desktop or the the Nook screen. Using the Android desktop which included the Android market I downloaded the Kindle reading app. I ran that app, logged into my Kindle account and now have all my Kindle book available on my Nook Touch. The only thing missing is text to speech but I didn't use that feature anyway. Yes it has a web browser, email and all the other Android apps available but most look pretty drab on a monochrome device. That isn't why I did this. I wanted a device to read my Nook Books and Kindle books.I now have the best of both worlds.,
","OK...first things first: I hate mice. And trackpads. If waving your whole arm around just to move a cursor or scroll a page is your idea of a good time, this review is not for you. I've been using Logitech Trackballs since back in the pre-Windows Dark Ages when they were carved out of wood and powered by steam. I still have 'em all too...just in case they ever quit making them and I have to cannibalize the old ones for parts.I currently have have 3 of the Cordless Trackmans (Trackmen?) on two desktops and my laptop. My wife uses a corded version on her laptop (she doesn't like dealing with the transmitter, I like being able to move the unit around without fighting the ferschlugginer cord.) We also use a corded version with the Asus Netbook at home although it's a bit too big to take on the road (we use one of those little one finger trackballs for that).Cons:It's probably a tad bigger and/or heavier than a regular mouse. If you aren't used to using one, you have to train your hand to use it intuitively (which takes about an hour for most people). And it ain't cheap compared to the mice you can buy for peanuts.Pros: You don't have to move it. It stays in one place and all you need to move is a finger or thumb to do whatever you want. And it takes up less than a quarter of the desk space of that dopey mouse pad. You CAN move it if you need to. So if you are, for instance, displaying your digital photos, you can back off a few feet and not make people peep over your shoulder while still controlling the display.Logitech's stuff is always well designed and bulletproof (I use their wireless keyboards too). I have to put a new battery in the cordless trackballs about every 3 or 4 months on the machines I use every day (the software will warn you when it's time). Maintenance is a snap: pop the ball out (there's a hole in the bottom to push a pencil thorough), wipe the mung off the inside and pop the ball back in. Takes 10 seconds. The software is easy to install and configure with lots of options. You can program the buttons and scroll wheel to do different tasks. You can also change cursors and cursor speed and set it to automatically set the cursor on the default button.Oh yeah...they use 'em on ""NCIS"" so they must be good.  :),
","As many others have pointed out, this is a fantastic unit - WHEN it works.  They can make a 'cheap' DVD recorder, so why can't they make a 'cheap' AND good CD Recorder?  I'm still waiting.COOLING ISSUE: Anyhow, what I did to my unit work better was to take off the cover, drill enough holes in the cover to make it look like Swiss cheese, then add a small computer fan inside the case to blow towards the CDR inside.  I run the fan off of a small 'wall wart' AC adapter.  It has worked okay since then, UNITL the time that I didn't plug-in my (noisy) internal fan, and sure enough, it locked-up.  So, I'm ASSUMING that there is a heating / lack of COOLING issue with these units, unless somebody can tell me something else.  Obviously, unplug the unit from the AC mains before you take the cover off, make sure all metal burrs are cleaned from the cover, and securely mount the little cooling fan inside.  Make sure you have a rubber grommet or electrical tape to protect the DC wire from the AC adapter to prevent a short where it passes into the case.  Put it back together and see if it works.  Please report back here if you try adding a fan to yours, and how it worked for you.  No warranty expressed or implied, and your mileage may vary.  No responsbile for 'boat anchors' if you break something while putting in your little fan/cooling units.I have noticed no difference between the 74 and 80 minute disks.  Good luck; I sure wish Philips would make a new and improved working unit like this, with proper cooling hardware!!,

82,"Barnes and Noble hit one out of the park with this ereader! compact, great e-ink infrared touch screen, microsd card slot, two-month battery life, wifi, support for pdf and epub, and best of all, running Android!the STR has already been rooted, and handily runs Android and a host of goodie apps - but even if you don't want to crack your unit, you'll still enjoy a nice ereader and simple-to-use interface:- fast, responsive, and crystal clear screen - even in sunlight- touch right or left sides of screen to page forwards or backwards - OR - use the hardware buttons on the top sides of the frame- use 'shelves' to organize your titles- view titles as icons or in a list- insert bookmarks, notes- look up words instantly with its built-in dictionary- change fonts, font sizes on the fly- purchase titles via wifi or copy from your computer- and much more...no ereader is perfect, but this one comes close; i held off buying one until the market provided lots of choices - and the STR is the one i've been waiting for!btw, if you have an ereader, you should also get the free cross-platform ebook app, calibre - it is an *essential* ereader companion, and can be used to convert DRM-free ebooks to nearly any format for nearly all ereaders, include the new Nook Simple Touch!,
","I recently purchased two of the Logitech Cordless TrackMan Wheel trackballs. I needed/wanted one for my desktop Windows PC and one for my desktop Mac. I first hooked it up and installed it on the Windows PC and immediately loved it. Its ergonomic design makes it very comfortable (only for right handers) and the tracking is very responsive. I looked forward to installing it on my Mac.I researched customer reviews, Logitech's Web site, PC World's Web site and Mac World. I could not find any support or even troubleshooting ideas for getting this product to work with my Mac. I was disappointed because I really do like the trackball. Additionally, the packaging claims that it is Mac compatible but if that's true, there's no help or Mac related instructions. Even the CD ROM that comes with the trackball does not have any MAC executables on it. So, I sent it (the second one) back. After doing some more research I bought, for my Mac, the Kensington Expert Mouse Trackball (model number 646325). Guess what? IT IS WAY BETTER than the Logitech. It is more expensive and it is NOT WIRELESS but in addition to being extrmely comfortable and responsive, it comes with a detachable wrist rest. I've priced comparable wrists rests and a comparable one is $15 - $20.The Logitech is not suitable for laptops because a wired USB receiver needs to be plugged into your computer for the trackball to work. This would be very cumbersome in a laptop environment.So, while the Logitech is a very good product, it is not, in my humble opinion, the best or most comfortable trackball out there. That, and the Mac non compatibility issue are the only reasons I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5. While some may argue that the price difference makes the Logitech a better ""value"" I disagree. These are items that I use 10 to 15 hours six days a week and having a comfortable solution that will prevent stress and/or carpal tunnel...well, an extra $15 or $20 for that is prevention I'm HAPPY to pay.Buy this product for your Windows PC with confidence. If you buy the Logitech, for additional comfort, also buy the  ""Fellowes Gel Flex Transparent Mini Wrist Rest (Blue Crystal)"" for $12.99 at Amazon.Or, if you don't need a wireless solution buy the Kensington, which has a very comfortable padded wrist rest included.Happy Computing!,
","I bought the Polaroid 1100 for my son, a 5 year old that loves to take pictures. This camera seemed to have it all: decent resolution, a flash, USB connection, video cable to view the pictures on TV, 2x zoom and macro focus mode, 4 quality settings, an optical viewfinder to save batteries, AC adapeter included, photomax software, shot timer, wrist strap, and a durable case design with padded vinyl case.When it arrived, my son took about 50 pictures the first day, and although many of them were horrible, it didn't cost a thing to develop. The rechargeable NiCad batteries that I bought specifically for this camera were terrible, and they ran out after about 10 pictures... even with the display turned off. I tried some AA rechargeable NiMH batteries from my son's remote control car, and they lasted 3 or 4 times longer.With the 4MB compact flash card, you can only get 8 to 10 pictures in the highest resolution, and since we wanted to use most of the good photos in a screensaver at fullscreen on a 1024 x 768 monitor, the high setting is the lowest acceptable quality. I'll probably buy a 64MB card soon, and that will let him take over 150 pictures in the highest quality mode before the card is full.As far as the picture quality goes... you pretty much need to use the flash all of the time. You can take nice pictures  outdoors in the sun without the flash, but that's about it.The macro function works very well, but you need to make sure you are VERY close to your subject. My 3 year old daughter got in my lap one night, so I grabbed the camera and took a few pictures of her looking at me from less than a foot, and they were incredible. With my $700 SLR camera, I couldn't get that close and still be in focus, so those types of pictures will be priceless when the kids are older.My only major gripe about the camera is that it's not very quick to switch ""modes"", which requires using the display screen menu system. Then, your custom settings seem to last as long as you leave the power on, and then it reverts back to the default settings. For example, if you set the flash to ""Always On"", take a few shots, then turn the power off to save batteries... when you turn it on again a few minutes later, the flash is back in ""Auto"" mode, and won't necessarily fire on your next picture. Since you ALWAYS need the flash, this is an annoyance that bugs me. The 2x zoom feature works the same way... you need to activate this option using the menu, and when you turn the power off, the camera goes back to the default settings.In summary, considering that I got this camera for less than $100, it's an incredible bargain. I didn't expect it to capture images that I could print 8 1/2"" x 11"" photos. I mostly wanted a way for my son to take all the pictures he wanted, share them on the computer screen or TV, and possibly print a few on 4"" x 6"" photo paper. For what my son needs, this is a perfect camera at a perfect price. If you can get one for less than $120, go for it... but make sure you have some good rechargeable AA batteries to use with it.,

83,"I need to buy a gift for my mother's birthday and I know she likes to read books while on break at her job. I thought the Nook would be a great gift for her, after reading reviews here on Amazon that it can download and read free ebooks from library sites. Our local library offers ebooks so I thought it would be great.After getting the Nook, I learned a number of things:1. The Nook does NOT have a browser. It can only connect to the Barnes and Noble online bookstore.2. You are REQUIRED to have a valid credit card, even to download free content.3. While there is a way to root (hack) the Nook and thus enable a functional browser, it voids the warranty and is way too complicated to follow. I shouldn't have to hack a device to enable such a basic functionality.My mother isn't very computer savvy, and doesn't own a credit card, so I couldn't give her something like this. If it let you connect to library sites and download library books for free, it would be an ideal ereader. In it's current form, it's an overly-complicated money sinkhole. Now I'm out $70 and I still need to buy my mother a birthday present.I don't know why some of these other reviewers claim it can be used to download library ebooks. Claiming that a device has a functionality that it in fact does not have, is a really despicable thing to do.If you don't mind a wireless device owning a copy of your credit card, and throwing money at it to read books, then the Barnes & Noble Nook is right for you. If you are looking for an easy to use Ereader for library ebooks, STAY AWAY!,
","I have loved the Logitech TrackMan trackballs, particularly the ""marble"" versions. I have used almost every version they have produced. This particular model of the famous Marble is my favorite - precise thumb control of the ball, and easy fingering of the buttons and scroll wheel, all combined with a perfect ergonomic design that allows hours of comfortable use.When I went to a Mac recently, I reluctantly but dutifully got a Mac power mouse. BIG mistake. I hate, hate, hate using a mouse! So I hooked my old TrackMan up to the Mac keyboard and - Voila! - my right hand was happy again. And I was effortlessly zooming around the screen. And joyfully experiencing, once again, the superiority of a right-click context menu (that Control-Click BS is something I never will understand about Macs).Since I have become a Mac devotee and would never go back to PC - especially now that I found I could use my beloved trackball - I decided to treat myself to the convenience of the new cordless TrackMan. Same great product I'd been using for years, just without the ""string."" Others might complain about the size of the transmitter and the length of the cord that attaches it to the computer, but it is easily concealed. My keyboard drawer is delightfully free of clutter, with only my new, ultra-thin Mac keyboard and my cordless TrackMan. Life is sweet!If you, like me, prefer a trackball to a mouse, you will love this cordless version. If you are a regular mouse user, I urge you to consider the liberating experience of keeping your hand in one place and letting ""your fingers do the walking."",
","It would seem that my review has turned out to be a sort of comparison of the Sennheiser HD 598s to the HD 600s.  While it wasn't where I intended to go, I think the comparison is valid when deciding if the $200 premium is worth the payout (it is).I have owned/auditioned a ton of headphones over the years, and I currently have a pretty decent assortment in my stable.  But these HD 600s are probably going to have all those other pairs collecting dust.  About a month ago I had purchased a pair of HD 598s and they were the pair of cans that finally sold me on open phones.  I really like the 598s, and they are excellent for classical, jazz, classic rock, and many other genres music.  However, when it came to listening to contemporary popular music they just seemed to come up short.  The HD 600s are a much better ""all around"" headphone, and well worth the additional $200 (in my opinion).  Their superiority was evident from the moment I put them on and plugged them in.  I played Chris Isaac's ""Wicked Game"" and I literally had a chill run up my spine.  More bass than the 598s?  Yes; but it's not unnatural in any way whatsoever.  It just adds to the richness/quality of the overall sound.  These make everything just sound more real, and they seem to do it almost effortlessly.  After listening to the 600s for an extended period and then going back to the 598's, the differences become more noticeable.  Again,  where the 598s start to struggle, the 600s just power through.  I completely understand why so many people consider these to be some of the best phones ever produced.  I have also been tricked into looking around the room for that noise I just heard only to realize it was part of the recording.  If you need to stick to a budget, the 598s are an excellent choice and a fantastic bargain (just watch and wait for the price to dip).  However, if you can afford the premium price, the HD 600s are worth every penny.My listening setup consists of a variety of digital files played from my computer, an Onkyo C-7030 CD player, and a Nuforce Icon DAC/Headphone Amp.  I should also add that I don't use any equalization with my phones.  I messed around running the phones directly off the computer's headphone jack, and I have to say that I highly recommend a good DAC/Amp to get the most out of these cans, as the added power really brings them to life.  And remember that to truly ""Listen"" to these phones you need to be in a quiet environment.A few other observations:  The 600's clamp quite a bit tighter than the 598s, though they do seem to be loosening up a bit with use.  I think the 598s actually sound a bit wider and a touch brighter, but my 600's only have about 15 hours on them at this writing and like the 598s, I expect them to open up after more time.  I may invest in a better cable in the future, but the included cable gets the job done, and it's more flexible than the one for the 598's (which I also replaced).  I had thought about comparing these to some of my other closed phones for my review, but really, I don't feel that any of them even comes close to these 600s. I've also noticed that with the 598's it is important to find that sweet spot in the volume where the sound really starts to shine, while the 600's play much better and more balanced over a wider range of volume (high and low).I am looking forward to enjoying these headphones for many years to come.  If you have any comments or questions I welcome them and will try my best to answer.  I did extensive research prior to this purchase, so if I can't answer a specific question I may be able to point you in the right direction.Update 1:  After probably 20 more hours of listening I can clarify my comment about the 598s being a little bit brighter.  On certain pieces when I hear a high-hat cymbal on the 598's, I hear it as one sound, and mostly the sound of the cymbal.  On the 600's you clearly hear the stick hitting the cymbal, and the sound of the cymbal itself.  So, I would say the high end of the 600s may not be perceived as being as bright as the 598's, but it is much more defined, clear, and controlled.,

84,"MORE UPDATES at the bottom of my review!My review includes details of Kindle 3, the newest version! With the time period, I could still return my nook, but I'm still completely in love with it and don't want the kindle for the reasons below.I was one of those people who was averse to the idea of an e-reader for a long time. I liked the feel of a real book, I was in love with free books at the library, why would I start paying for them? Then, my library got ""overdrive"", which is e-books FREE from the library. Then one day soon after, I woke up and the urge for an e-reader was there. The Nook was my final choice. It took a lot of back and forth and research to get to this point. I bought and tried the Sony Touch reader, returned it, and went and got the Nook. I really honestly wanted the Kindle most, because I'm a loyalist. I love Amazon and felt really comfortable here if I decided to actually start purchasing books again. But below, I'll give you comparisons to the three big readers and the reasons I got the nook:- Nook(N) by barnes & noble- Kindle 3(K) by amazon.com- Sony Reader Touch(ST)1. My biggest decision maker was Epub. This is the format in which you can take ebooks out of the library, so I needed whatever I got to be Epub friendly.N: The Nook is epub friendly. As well as PDF, and many other formats.K: The Kindle won't use Epub, which was all I needed to know. It mainly uses it's own Amazon format,while it also uses PDF, mobi and a few others. It makes me feel like Amazon is being greedy, wanting us to only use and buy books from the amazon site. Don't they understand that I love my library?ST: Sony reader is Epub friendly. pretty much the same as the nook.2. PRICE!N: 149 with wifiST: 169 NO WIFIK: 139 with wifi(or 189 with wifi and free 3G)While kindle 3 is 10 dollars cheaper, it doesn't give me those free library books, so it really doesn't make any difference to me.*You can now lend some books from the Nook for 14 days to a friend with their new ""lend me"" technology. While this is in beta stages, and not ALL books are lendable. It depends on the agreement with the publisher. The other two you cannot lend at all.*The Nook has a replaceable, rechargable battery. So it'll last awhile, but when its dwindling, you can spend 30 bucks and put a new one in yourself. For the Kindles, they are sealed inside. People have said you can do it yourself, but you must be tech savvy. Or you can send it away to Amazon for about the cost of [...]+shipping charges and they'll replace it for you.*You can expand your memory on the Nook and on the Sony touch. The Kindle you cannot, though the Kindle will hold 3,500 books, don't know if you need more space then that?!*Nook has a fancy color touch screen at the bottom. While the Sony touch has a touch screen(the entire screen), it was slow to respond, very klunky and not very pretty. The kindle is loaded with buttons along the outside of the screen.* all three have a built in dictionary, which I think is just awesome.*The new kindle now meets with the nook on their slim width. People used to say the nook was more comfortable to hold because of the width, now the kindle will be as well.*Yet, the Nook is heavier by about 3 oz then the Kindle or Sony.*The Nook battery life lasts about 10 days with wifi off, the Sony has 14 days, and the new kindle is up to a month with wifi off(3 weeks with it on)This wasn't a big deal to me, and I was more interested in the other features the Nook DID have, like replaceable battery and expandable memory.*And you may be wondering, why did I purchase a Sony Touch, and then scamper back hours later to return it? Well. When I got it out of the box, it wasn't techy enough for me. It felt like a very basic, bare bones E-reader. And I already had in my head all the things you hear about the nook: books more expensive, and for some reason I thought it wasn't epub friendly. But the moment I had that Sony in my hand, I went to look at the nook more indepth online. The Sony online library was nothing in comparison to Kindle's Amazon.com or Nook's Barnes & Noble. One of my favorite reads recently was The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It was nowhere to be found on Sony. That gave me a bad taste in my mouth.*In the past people have complained that Barnes & Noble is significantly more expensive then Amazon. I did some price comparisons of big titles, and found them most of the time to be exactly the same. I think Barnes & Noble might be trying to keep in line with Amazon to draw more readers(Like ME!) into getting the Nook.On the whole, the nook is everything I wanted. I've downloaded some free classics from google books, I've taken out library ebooks and it was REALLY easy! I even bought my first book(well, ebook) in a long time. Despite being a new release, it was under ten bucks. I also bought another book I've been meaning to read for years for under four dollars. The nook is comfortable to hold with one hand. I like the using the touch screen to ""swipe"" and turn pages. And tops on my list, I didn't feel horrificly guilty for buying it. One fifty is a reasonable price for such a fun new book reader.Update Oct '10: A software update is coming in Nov:""dramatically increase page turn speed, customized B&N; Library organization and password protection. It also includes the ability to sync across all NOOK and all devices enabled with our free NOOK apps, by syncing your last page read. If you forget your NOOK at home, use the NOOK app for iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, Android smartphone or PC to pick up where you left off. And, the next time you pick up your NOOK, the Reading Now page will be updated and ready to go.Update Dec '10: The update was a pinch to install, and it has some stellar perks that make the nook even more loveable. The shelving option it a lot of fun for those people who like to organize. You can name a shelf anything you want. The only limit is your Barnes and Noble book will stay in their Barnes folder, while any other books you have will stay in My Documents. The page turn is very fast. I do read across multiple devices, but for most people that will be a great new feature.,
","A while ago I wrote a simple review of this stating how well it works.  I've since changed that statement... I am absolutely disappointed in the performance of this unit!This unit will work fine if you are indoors - I have had a 95% failure rate outdoors in a variety of lighting conditions, and as close as 1' from the unit.  Everything I've read during my extensive pre-purchase research led me to believe (blindly) that it could at least get moderate success at a relatively close range (5-10').  All the DIY hacks in the world in regards to foil or other reflective attachments aren't enough to increase the communications between the flash and this unit.You are probably better off in the long run to save a fairly respectable chunk of your hard-earned money and put buy a set of Cactus V2 triggers (A.K.AL ""Ebay"" triggers/""Poverty Wizards"").  They will set you back about $30-40 for a decent set.  True, they are NOT a Pocket Wizard in any sense of the word, and will not perform even near the same.  However, they certainly beat the annoyances that are sure to come when using this product (line-of-sight is not always possible with OTC flash).In fact, the best option for those not willing to shell out $200-300, may want to check out PC sync cables.  Yes, I know, it's an older technology (some say more cumbersome), but with the right quality brands on equipment - as many things in life - you get a very stable and consistent set up.  No more explaining to your client why you didn't get that last shot.Okay...back on topic...PROS- Compatible with all Canon Speedlites- Offers wireless triggering capabilities for off-the-camera flash- Has decent battery life- Can trigger multiple flashes simultaneously- Fairly simple to use- Convenient buttons for high-speed sync and flash power settings- Works well in small to medium-sized roomsCONS- Only works with Canon Speedlite series of flashes- Non-standard battery- No battery-life indicator- No 2nd curtain (slow-sync) flash capabilities- Unreliable in outdoor settings (and some indoor)- A little pricey, based on features,
","My new HD600 arrived with the sound cutting in and out on the right side. I feared I would have to exchange them but Googled for the problem and came across the Head-fi guide which said this:""Troubleshooting/Known Issues:Some HD 600s are known to ship with the cable inserted loosely. This can cause the sound to cut out of either side when the cable is moved. To fix this, push the cable in hard, not just a little hard, but push it in with the angry fist of a god hard. Once it's in hard, it should stay that way on it's own.""Sure enough when I pushed the cord in hard on that side, it moved further in by almost 2mm, and the sound has been rock stable ever since. I wonder how many people return or exchange these thinking they are faulty when all it would take is one good hard push to seat the cable properly!Now onto the brief review...Sound: These headphones produce the most natural sound that I have experienced from headphones.  Nothing is exaggerated.  The mids are beautiful.  Vocals sound incredible.  Highs are less sparkly or less harsh depending on your perspective.  Bass is a bit loose when plugged directly into my Macbook Air or phone but tightens up considerably with my Schiit Asgard 2  amp.  These shine on just about any genre with the exception of the sub-bass being inadequate for a small subset of my rap and electronic music (but still great on most rap and electronic and virtually all rock, pop, jazz, funk, soul, classical).  I don't hear quite as much detail with these as with my Beyerdynamic DT880 Pro (250 ohm), but there is plenty of detail there, and I wouldn't call them veiled.Build: Light, seems solid, fully modular with parts available for replacement.  Cable is very long, thinner/lighter than some of my other headphones, and seems to resist tangling.  Cable can be replaced like everything else.  Very comfortable on my big head and ears though not quite as comfortable as my Beyerdynamic DT770 and DT880.  The Beyers totally encircle my ears, hardly touching them.  The HD600 is more snug, touching all the way around.  The marbled finish looks okay in person.  From the pictures, I thought it was going to look terrible.Most headphones in my collection and nearly all popular headphones these days have a V-shaped sound, emphasizing bass and highs.  The HD600 are a wonderful contrast to that, with an overall neutral signature and the gorgeous mids.,

85,"MY WIFE ADORES THIS PRODUCT !!It was our household's first e-reader.There IS a little learning curve at first and expect to need a household pc to talk to it via a usb micro (not MINI) data cable WITH DATA capability (some usb cables are just charge-only) and if you get a used deal on one without a usb micro data+power ability, you are looking at up to $20.00 (unless you get one cheaper taking a risk on a crappier cable).---Only thing is it's hard for someone whose disabled with touching or vision issues to use... though you can increase font size, the rare occasion you have to type something out it's kinda small but that doesn't happen often on the nook itself.----She uses hers mainly to check things out from the Clark County Library District in Las Vegas.  Once we registered with the Library, we installed Adobe Digital Editions which is the digital rights management... that took some doing but once in place, you tell the ADE of the nook you have, authorize it, and then from that point on anytime you want to check out a library book you simply go to their site, check out the electronic version which comes into your computer where the ADE recognizes it and outputs it to your nook.After x amount of days...when the checkout time expires, the file disables itself and you either get another book from the library or re check-in/check-out the same one for another x days.It makes the public library a whole new experience and that's great because, guess what...your tax dollars paid for it !  and the author gets their cut too.....Win-win all around....We've never bought an e-book from barnes and noble yet, and you do have to register the nook with them at first though you don't have to put in a credit card, but that step is probably skippable it's just handy because if you want help from b&n; they'll want you to at least register the product with them..not a big deal and it's one-time during your initial set-up procedures (and that's the one time you need to use the aforementioned little hard to type on 'typewriter' display.Happy Nooking(P.S.  as a bad pun, I told my wife that if The 3 Stooges owned it, it would be a Nook-Nook-Nook... but I was frowned at.  Guess it's funnier if Curley is your favorite stooge.  I digress :)  ),
","We originally bought this bag at Wal-Mart for my husband's Canon T3i camera, we hesitated on it because it was so expensive. However, we got it and were happy with the quality of the bag. We knew that if you were going to spend that much on a camera, you would absolutely need to get a durable bag to protect it.Well, we love getting great deals and my husband, feeling as though he did not get a great deal, decided to check out the price on Amazon when we got home. Wouldn't you know it, it was more than $20 cheaper on Amazon! So we returned the one we got and ordered it here. If it could be possible, the bag that arrived from Amazon, seemed to be in better shape for some reason. Meaning that it didn't seem as beat up as the one we had just bought at the store!Many have commented on the size of the bag being misleading. They aren't lying. We weren't disappointed because like I said, we had just got one at Wal-Mart.  We only use one camera per case so we didn't need to put more than one camera in it. I really don't see how you could put more than one camera in it. My husband has one other lens that he puts in this bag and it does fit. We keep our extra batteries in here plus an extra card or two.  We got the big grip that goes on the bottom of the camera and houses the two batteries. We don't take it off to put it in this bag and it still fits fine.It also comes with a shoulder strap for those who want to sling it over your shoulder. I like the shoulder strap, but my husband doesn't so he took it off (it unclips).The material for the bag is thick and sturdy. There is an extra little zipper in the bag itself as well as on the outside. There is all sorts of neat little compartments on this bag. Plus the front has a clip that keeps the front flap hooked down, so after you zip it up you can also clip it for extra security!I love this bag and would recommend it to those who only want to take one camera and one lens at a time. If you need to take more than this, well, you might want to consider something else.,
","Well, if you're here, then you probably know what you're looking at. If not, let me explain.The HD600 was introduced by Sennheiser as the replacement for their highly acclaimed HD580. It was essentially the HD580 Jubilee edition, but re-dressed and re-badged. As such, it shares nearly everything with the HD580 Jubilee, and shares it's drivers with the HD580. The HD600 has been on Stereophile's A list for ages, and hasn't budged despite passing years and many new models from competitors. It has also been the golden standard for neutrality and accuracy in recording studios worldwide.What does the HD600 sound like? Quite simply, it sounds much like the components that you have upstream, but with more weight and body to the sound. The HD600 is uncolored enough that every change in your signal path results in a different sound signature. You hear exactly how your CD player sounds, how your amp sounds, how your cables sound (yes, I know this statement disqualifies me with the audio cynics... well, so be it). In my experience with hi-fi and more specifically headphone hi-fi, I've yet to find another headphone that sounds so neutral, so very ""right"" with everything that I throw at it.It is detailed, but presents detail in a relaxed manner. It is very airy and open but doesn't sound thin. It has a strong bass but it's quite clear and well defined. It has a melodic midrange but it's clean and articulate. It has exactly the right tone and tembre on every instrument. And it does it all in a very coherent, integrated fashion. Everything is part of a greater sonic whole, and works together in a coherent fashion to recreate beautiful music. Most prominently, it has a sense of weight and solidity to every sound that is very much speaker-like. I have heard this kind of solidity in other headphones, but in many cases it has worked detrimentally to the music. In this case, it adds a sense of magical realism that's hard to find elsewhere.You probably are aware that this headphone needs an amp. That's definitely true. Don't connect it to an mp3 player expecting it to sing, because it won't. A dedicated headphone amplifier is a must. I will also go further than that and say that a dedicated hi-fi source is a must, since this headphone does, once again, sound like it's upstream components.Here's what I suggest for building a good headphone rig around the HD600:Start with an inexpensive source with an optical line-out. A cheap Sony D-NE920 will do quite well, or any other PCDP with an optical line-out. Next, get a standalone DAC, either a portable battery powered model like a Headroom MicroDAC (amazing little product) or a full-size jitter-immune DAC like the Benchmark DAC1. Next, if you're going the portable route, get a good portable amp - I use the Ray Samuels Hornet currently, and it's a killer piece of amplification. If you're going with a stationary home DAC, then make sure that it has balanced outputs, and get a true balanced amplifier (Headamp GS-X is a good model, as is the Heardoom Max Balanced, or perhaps a cheaper but still excellent SFT-build balanced M^3). Finish it off with a decent set of IC's (Grover Ultimate Reference is a great inexpensive cable), and replace the dinky cable that came with your HD600's (I like the Moon Audio cables myself). You'll need an XLR-terminated cable for your balanced amp. You can throw in power conditioning if you believe in that sort of thing, but it's really up to you. Lastly, throw on your favorite recording, relax, and enjoy. For this is what the HD600 will do - relax and let the music flow.I've heard some very serious phones - the Sennheiser Orpheus, Sony MDR-R10, Sony Qualia 010, together with countless less-expensive phones. Properly amped and properly driven, the HD600 can play with the best of them. It's a real steal at the price, but make sure to pair it with quality gear.****Let me address some previous reviews.To the gentleman who claimed that this sounds muddy next to Stax headphones - I agree. Stax headphones really are unique in terms of clarity, but since they're electrostatic, this is to be expected. However, driven balanced, the HD600 can come close to this sort of clarity, and will be more realistic in terms of tembre and texture. I prefer it in some ways over the SR-007, and I own the SR-404 myself, so I'm no stranger to Stax.To the reviewer below who claims that the A900 and MDR-V7506 are better phones: I suggest you get your facts straight. The HD600 is used nearly as much as the V7506 in the studio. I also happen to own the A900, and I honestly cannot say that it sounds just as natural as the HD600. It has an upper-midrange honky coloration that is distinctly artificial. Having played piano for 13 years, I know how the instrument is supposed to sound, and the HD600 is it. The A900 isn't. But, I will agree with you, to some extent, when it comes to the HD650. This latter phone is voiced rather differently from the HD600, and does sound colored to my ears.,

86,"I bought a Nook during one of my visits to Tampa, more specifically at the Wiregrass Shops. I must admit that I was tremendously excited when I got the device, because of the reviews and also the SD card capability.My joy was short lived. During the 2 weeks that I owned the product I was never able once to open none of my sideloaded pdf's that I have amassed over the years (over 30GB - I am a voracious reader). A long string of calls to Customer Service and the shop itself ensued, after which I decided to take the trip again (I live outside of the USA) to return the device directly to the store.Much to my surprise, they were extremely receptive at the store and also very apologetic for the device's inability to function properly outside the States and also the lack of functionality and propietary issues. I was refunded for all the items (Nook, cover case and screen protector) in no time at all.So, in summary, the Nook gets a ZERO star in my review for paying more attention to the esthetics rather than the functionality of the reader, but B&N; gets a FIVE star rating for their approachability and for their great costumer service!,
","I'll start off by saying that this item IS compatible with the Rebel XTi (I've seen conflicting information floating around).I just recently purchased my XTi and noticed that even when using a tripod that my pictures would come out slightly blurred a lot of the time - I'm assuming this is from the vibration when pressing and releasing the shutter button. This made long-exposes such as night photography difficult for me and often left me disappointed with the results.Fortunately I found this great item! It plugs into the side of the camera by the USB connector and features basic controls (half click, full click, and the ability to click and lock the button).One of the first things you'll notice is the short cord - something almost every single review has mentioned but I really didn't think it would be THAT short - this is both a Pro and a Con.. A ""Pro"" because it doesnt leave lots of slack that can become tangled or drop loosely to the ground but also a ""Con"" because you still need to remain relatively close to the camera for this to function.. If you're dealing with Macro (up-close) photography with live animals it would be nice to set the camera up and sit 5-10 feet away and remotely trigger the camera without being close enough to scare them away. Another time a long cord would be nice would be for self-photography and to place a camera in a place which is otherwise not reasonable for you to get to (such as a high location, on a roof, in a tree, etc..)Apparently you can get a little ""Do it yourself"" with this item and splice a longer cable onto it if you feel the need. They also sell a wireless remote which is probably even better for these needs  but you have to keep a direct connection between the camera and the remote).Back to this remote switch though:By half-pressing the remote, the camera will autofocus (much as it does when half-pressing the shutter button on the actual camera) and fully pressing it will release the shutter and snap a picture.The part that becomes quite nice is the ""Lock"" function. This lets you lock the button down (done by full-clicking and sliding the button to the side) for as long as you want while the shutter remains open - this means you can lock it for 5 minutes for pinhole photography or night shots - something you would otherwise need to keep your finger on the shutter release button for (which will almost always cause some vibration/shaky pictures).You do this by setting the exposure time to ""Bulb"" mode (from what I can tell, its only available in [M] mode on the XTi).A very excellent remote switch that is more than worth the $20-30 selling price (just don't tell canon!) - If I could make one change it would be to have the camera use a replaceable cable so that you could easily unplug the 2 foot one and replace it with a 5 or 10 foot one since it appears to just be a standard audio cable.All-in-all, a must-buy which is also very affordable!,
","I tried the HD600s years ago and disliked them. To me, they sounded a bit dark and slow--so I returned them. The problem wasn't the HD600s, it was my pathetic amp. It was a cheap little NuForce USB amp. After some research over the years, I discovered that the HD600s will not reach their full potential until they are powered by a good amp. Since these are high impedance headphones, an OTL amp is best. And based on my research and experience, a tube OTL amp is even better.For those of you using the HD600s with a cheap Fiio or similar amp, please do yourself a favor and look into a good OTL tube amp and these headphones will amaze you. That's no exaggeration. If you own these headphones, you likely paid around $400 for them (new). If you spend around the same amount on your amp, you can get a decent OTL tube amp, and you will take your HD600s to an entirely new level of performance. With a good amp, you will laugh at the thought of the HD600s having a ""veil"" and lackluster treble performance. A good OTL tube amp makes these headphones sparkle. The beauty of having a tube amp is that you can change the tubes and tune the sound to get exactly what you want. Need deeper bass? Need smoother treble? Want more clarity? All of these can be done by changing tubes.Right now, I'm listening to my HD600s with a Schiit Bifrost DAC and a Woo Audio WA3 amp. With this combination, the HD600s sound amazing for both rock and classical. I also upgraded the cable to the HD650 cable.I've listened to the HD600s on a Beyerdynamic A1 amp, a Bottlehead Crack (without the Speedball upgrade), and my Woo Audio WA3.  The WA3 is by far the best of these three amps.  It is magic with the HD600s.  However, the Bottlehead Crack is also VERY good with the HD600s.  Frankly, I didn't particularly like the sound of the A1 amp; it seemed lifeless to me.  I prefer tube amps.,

87,"So, I bought the nook a few weeks ago when the price cut went into action and was constantly going back and forth with the thoughts of buying this, or buying the kindle.I bought the device with 3G simply because it was only a little more, and I travel a lot and don't have house wi-fi. I remember when I used to scoff at the nook when walking into B&N; and can't believe I ever did that! I love the feel of being able to go into the bookstore, with my nook and feel connected to the actual store. I will admit you have to do your research (read forums, articles etc...) because the nook demo employees, are not going to know everything. Also you MUST read the 'manual' and follow it to a 'T' Don't take the reader out of the box and drain what little battery you have left because you're going to have battery issues (needing it to drain completely a few times and then fully charging it before the battery is at full capacity)A lot of people may think their nook is 'frozen' when actually the battery is drained, and when that happens the screen is set to whatever screen saver, book page etc you were on when it died. There's no 'power-down' it will just stop, and touchscreen will not be active, once you plug it up and charge it a little, it will be good again. Also the constant use of the touchscreen will drain the unit faster (obvious unfortunate fact)There are a lot of books available at the moment (depending what genre you read) especially for teen and sci-fi and fiction (my books), and I was surprised to see all of the 'lend me features' for a good portion of the books I was interested in. Also B&N; really listens to complaints and proves that with upgrades (faster page turning, less freezing etc.)Also even when there was a manufacturing error, they were quick to send out a new improved nook. Overall, I love this device, it's fun, its sleek with a solid feel, and it's open-ended for future updates.It may be for you, it may not. Do your research, read forums and reviews, go into the respective stores and hold and try the device.Pros:Removable/replaceable batteryReally crisp 'paper' and 'words'e-wish list for booksSD card slotAudio/ musicFree coupons, discounts, and food monthly via nooke pub librarygetting books from Sony ADELending featureConsBattery lasts an average of 7-8 daystouchscreen keyboard a bit small (if you're used to iphone/ipod)touchscreen may be over sensitive with accidental touchSmall price differences with kindle books (average of a dollar),
","Definitely a must-have accessory if you are doing long exposure or macro photographs.  I'm using mine with an EOS Rebel XTi and it works exactly like I expected.A half press sets focus/exposure and a full press releases the shutter.  Identical to the shutter button on the camera.  To hold the shutter open, you can continue holding the remote button down with your thumb, or you can slide the ""lock"" upwards and it will hold the button down for you.  Slide the lock down and it will release the button.  Ideal for use when the shutter is in ""BULB"" mode.For the price paid, it seems a little bit flimsy and fragile.  I wouldn't expect it to hold up under heavy duty use, but for my purposes, I expect it to last quite a while.  The half-press/full-press of the button is hard to ""feel.""  Unlike with the camera's button, you don't get a lot of feedback on when to stop pressing for a half-press.  Not a huge deal - the worst thing that would happen on a digital is a few extra shots on your memory card.If you need an external shutter release for your photography, don't hesitate on buying this Canon model.  If you see it for less than $10, buy two!,
","This is one impressive device. I am a devoted Palm user and have owned several, but I have to admit I am very impressed with the power and  capabilities of this PDA.First, the screen. I own a color Palm IIIc, and  overall I am extremely happy with it. However, the screen resolution is  only 160 x 160, and looks a little grainy, but it's okay. By comparison,  the Casio is 240 x 360, and is just drop-dead gorgeous. No contest  there.My Palm IIIc has only 256 colors but the Casio is full 16-bit with  64k colors. By comparison, the Compaq iPAQ is only 12-bit. The HP is also  12-bit (not 16-bit as advertised--a little scandal there). Still, I would  kill to have 12-bit color on my IIIc. The Casio's screen is active-matrix  but the Jornada is passive-matrix, so it &quot;washes out&quot; when viewed  at an angle. Still, the screen brightness is very good. Not sure about the  iPAQ, but the Palm does have an active-matrix screen, and the screen  brightness is excellent. In fact, it will light up a whole room in the  dark. But the Casio's screen brightness is also excellent.I noticed one  thing about the new iPAQ's screen. Although it is noticeably brighter than  the Casio's, because it is backlit, it looks somewhat &quot;milky&quot;  under lower-light conditions. I work under somewhat low-light conditions  much of the time, so for me the Caso has an edge there. The iPAQ is better  for bright light conditions. Still, both units have excellent  screens.The Casio has 32 megs of RAM. The HP and Compaq have 16, and the  Palm has 8 megs. The just-released iPAQ 3600 ups this to 32, like the  Casio. However, you're going to need that 32 megs of RAM, since the  memory-hungry Windows CE apps will eat that up quickly. On my Palm, I have  over 100 apps and utilities in only about 7 megs of space, and still have  1.2 megs left over for other stuff.I haven't tried the MP3 capability  yet, but I read that a couple of songs will pretty much use up all the RAM.  Also, I understand downloading is slow, up to a half hour for a single  song. So I'm not sure how practical this feature is yet, but still, there  is no doubt multi-media is part of the future of Palm-top computing.The  battery life at 6 hours is acceptable. My Palm Vx will go for 40 hours or  about a month between charges--but this is a monochrome unit, so it's not a  fair comparison. However, my IIIc color unit, although Palm states 8-20  hours of battery life, really won't go more than about 2-3 hours on full  intensity in my experience. Most of the time I find I can run it at about  2/3 intensity and extend the life somewhat.The Casio at almost 10 ounces  is heavy compared to the Palms, which range from 4.4 at the low end with  the Vx to almost 7 ounces at the high end with the IIIc and the wireless  VII. You can carry the Palms your front pocket, but this is really not  practical with the Casio. Still, I don't mind the extra bulk given all the  additional power and capabilities. Iin my opinion, it is powerful enough to  substitute for a laptop on most trips.The final thing I wanted to  mention is the natural handwriting recognition is very nice. The Graffiti  system on the Palm takes some learning and getting used to. At this point I  am pretty expert with Graffiti, but I found it was nice to use my own  handwriting for once. There is a program for the Palm, called Jot, that  will allow you to use your normal handwriting. I've tried it and although  it's an excellent program, it's still not as good as the Window's CE  devices.Although I love my Palm, I have to say the Casio and similar  devices really look to be the future of Palm-top computing. The high-res  color screen, the multi-media capability, the digital voice recorder, the  ability to use Windows apps, the ability to use a fully graphical web  browser instead of a web-clipping app like on the Palm, and the ability to  add IBM's 340-meg Microdrive through the Type II slot are all powerful  features. None of these features are really available on the Palm.All in  all, this is a great PDA. Whether you're a died-in-the-wool Palm  afficianado or a recently converted Pocket PC user, you're looking at the  future of Palm-top computing. And in this device most of that future is  already here.,

88,"After what I thought was a thorough research between the Kindle, nook & Sony ereaders, I took the plunge & bought the nook. What appealled to me most were the web browser & ePub use to check out books from the library. However, after fully charging the nook, I took it with me for a weekend at the beach. I didn't bring the the charger because B&N; said battery would last up to 10 days with wireless off. Well, I found out the hard way, with wireless on, it barely a couple hours reading at night & in the afternoon by the beach. Oy, was I frustrated with nothing left to read & another night & afternoon left. Lesson learned: must bring charger everywhere! Lost 1 * for this.I'm not a fan of touch screens, still love my trusty push-button cellphone. So browsing the web was a pain for me, having to navigate around the screen with my finger. Page turning was fine, but I think I've overdone it since my finger began stinging from constant page-turning friction :0)). Scrolling down & up also frustrates me - most of the time I have to swipe several times to get it to move. Not to mention hitting the back button after book downloads - the response time was slow which made me think it didn't sense my touch, so I'd do it again & it goes back all the way to the main menu. Grrr! What a pain as I have to restart the store search & find the page again.B&N; samples are horrible! They give you 7 pages...but it's the cover, copyright, dedication page with only a paragraph of the actual story. Not enough to make me want to buy a book. The closest B&N; is 1 hour drive away so I couldn't take advantage of the cafe freebies or free reading in-store.After I discovered that I cannot organize books into folders, that was the final straw. I read novels with racy titles, my 10 y.o. son wanted to read his classics on the nook but I didn't want to lend it to him because he would see all my books & potentially read them. This is a biggie for me so lost another *.Features I'm happy with: I was able to check-out books from my library & I was able to put my pdf books on the nook. Yey! Unfortunately, my library just got into ebooks & have only a handfull of books so it'll be a while until I can fully take advantage of this feature.Well, these are my personal experiences with which I now realize that I didn't do a thorough reasearch as I first thought, LOL. My fault...but I still like my nook, though I'm no longer in love with it like when I first received it. I've also ordered the latest Kindle so we'll see which one I'll keep - I'm looking forward to the push-button keys on that, LOL.,
","As others have pointed out, the name might be a little misleading on this item. It is what most would call a shutter release as opposed to a remote. Calling it a ""Remote Switch"" implies to some that it is wireless. But the picture and description clearly state it is corded, so you're basically just arguing semantics at that point. Even Canon calls it a remote switch, so take it up with them.In my mind, the major reason to buy this is to eliminate the very little but potentially noticeable shake your hand exerts on the camera when you take a long-exposure shot. Those who are complaining about not being able to take self-portraits or the other limitations of a 2ft. cord need to look at the existing wireless solutions; there are different tools for different needs. And I don't know about you, but I'm a big fan of not having a few feet of slack cable hanging down from the a tripod that's top-heavy and holding ~$3,000 worth of equipment. I'd rather the cord be relatively short so anyone walking by doesn't accidentally snag it and pull down my whole setup. If you're shooting immediately behind the camera, the cord is long enough; my wife has even used it to keep her hands in her pockets during cold shoots, and it had slack enough for that.All that said, it does what it says it does: act as an extension of the shutter button while easily allowing you to make extra-long exposures. The build quality doesn't feel great, but I've dropped it several times and have it packed in the large pocket of our main camera bag that it shares with many other accessories, and it still works perfectly. I think part of it is that the device's electronics are very small and simple, so it's very light and feels cheap even though it might be pretty well constructed.Unless you're going to be far away from your camera while shooting or otherwise need the range, this will work perfectly and, unlike the wireless switches, does not require batteries that always seem to die at the worst times. I personally prefer wired connections where possible because, with all things considered, they are more reliable than wireless ones.A note: this does not work with the 40D/50D models. We got this for our Rebel XT and thought it might be usable with the 50D we recently bought, but no go. Understandable, but it would have been nice to not have to buy another one.Pros:- Reduces shake during long exposures- Allows photographer to keep hands in pockets during cold shoots- Wired, so doesn't depend on batteriesCons:- Overpriced- I would say cord length, but if you're looking for long range, you shouldn't even be looking at this item- Can't continue using it if you upgrade to anything higher than the 40D,
","The good old $10 transistor radio. That's what you get here. For that, it's nice.The Panasonic RF-P50 is 4-5/8"" tall, 2-3/4"" wide, and 1-1/8"" thick. Fits in a jacket or jeans pocket. Too tall for a T-shirt pocket. It's contoured nicely, with no sharp corners. It runs on two AA batteries, and I can get about 26 hours of constant use out of Rayovac alkalines.Assuming you're looking at the face of the radio...The left side has the On / Off dial, which is also the Volume dial. Under that is the audio jack, which is monoaural only. This means that with headphones or earbuds, you'll only get sound out the left ear. If you want sound out of both ears, buy a 3.5mm Female Mono to 3.5mm Male Stero Adapter for three dollars. Right above the volume dial is the wrist strap. It's a simply nylon cord, about 6"" long. In the rear of the left side is the antenna. It folds out, but doesn't swivel. It extends to 22"" long.The right side has the Tuning dial, underneath that, the AM / FM band selector switch. The back of the radio has the battery compartment. The speaker built into the P50 is 2-1/4"" in diameter and projects sound from the front. It's not too tinny, and is decent for the price. The product description lists two LEDs; one for signal strength and one for battery life. I can't find the battery life LED. It's nowhere on the radio, and nothing pops up when the radio is in use to indicate battery life. The signal strength LED (marked TUNING on the front) does work, but is a little deceptive: it lights up when you have a strong signal, but it gives no indication of the clarity of that signal. So you could get a perfectly good signal, but it's not clear enough to make anything out.The FM on this radio is acceptable, but the AM is just garbage. In the basement, on the porch, in the backyard, or in the car all get the same abysmal results on AM. The AM band maxes out at 1660KHz. The tuning dial is a little stiff, making it easy to skip past the channel you want.As a whole, the P50 is okay. I like the size and everything, except the AM is so bad it brings the rest of the good features down. For $10, the Sony ICF-S10 MK2 or Kaito KA200 are better.,

89,".Paid $[...] for this in April 2010.  Biggest waste of money I ever spent.  not worth the hassle of getting it repaired.  Made me miserable and unhappy for three days.  This is not how I want to spend my life--feeling miserable and abused and wondering how I got suckered into this huge mistake.The good--or perhaps the OK--I found nothing really good.GSM service is free for purchasing books and most uses. Not all that valuable.  I'd be happy with just WiFi and enough memory to carry around a personal library. with me.  GSM available for anything else but books.  Wifi works ok, after some fussing with the settings.  Many times I got error messages.  I kept trying until it worked.  There is some issue with the Wifi but it can be fussed with until it works--starting and stopping it.The bad--just about everything:I travel a lot, and need to carry my library with me.  This device does not work to download books outside of the US.  Why not?  I can understand the GSM not working, but if I have WiFi access somewhere, I should be able to load anything I want anywhere.  I can load books anywhere with my iPod Touch. Requires a US address.  Why?  Why can't anyone use it?  Device requires that you sign up with B&N; with a credit card.  Why can't I download free books without a B&N; account?  You cannot use this device until it is registered.This device is barely functional.  The interface is poorly designed, B&N; does a great job of making it difficult to find free books, and the books that are normally free--B&N; charges you $1 to $2 for these books! Outrageous!  Most people would not have a clue they are being ripped off being charged for books in the public domain.The interface is so bad that everyone is hacking these devices to make them functional.  Do a GOOGLE search for nook soft root--better yet check out YouTube and search for TROOK.Do a search on nook itself for free and you won't find free books, you will find books with ""free"" in the title or crippled editions with two chapters free.  There is no menu selection for find free books.  If you do find a free book it will be after wading through page after page of the same title--it would take days to find even a few interesting free books.  With the Kindle, at least you get to choose a few best sellers are part of your purchase price.  The B&N; give you nothing for free but garbage.  They want to frustrated enough to pay them more money for overpriced books.  Personally I can't see paying the same price for an electronic book as I do a paper bound book that I can resell or give as a gift.  Electronic books cost nothing to produce and distribute--why do they cost so much?  It is gouging, IMHO.To get a free book into your nook is a nightmare PITA.  I use an iPod Touch and was able to load 60 free books into it, in about 8 minutes--easy and simple.  Not menu after menu and then find out the book was not loaded after all.With B&N; nook it takes a long time to select and load a book.  You have to pay for a book, even if it is zero dollars--another menu choice, just to get you in the habit of hitting a purchase button.  There are lots of free books out there.  Why should it be hard to load these? Personally, I want a large library with me because I travel alot, and I want to find  what I want quickly, and I want to read it without hassle.PFD files can be loaded but these are not re-sized, so that type is pretty small and hard to read.  I can't read them, and I have reasonably good near vision.  If you are young with perfect vision you might be able to read for a while until your eyes get tired.  PDF don't work well on this device.Changing a page is a pain with the controls.  There is a way to use a finger swipe that some people have difficulty with.I personally hate wading through 40-60 pages on the life of the author, at the beginning of the book when all I want to do is read the book itself.  Books with a ton of crap in the front, with articles about the life of the author, acknowledgments, are a PITA toget around.  Scrolling down to chapter one to start the book is problematic--sometimes you are sent back to the index, other times you go to Chapter one. Why should I have to scroll and enter a command twice.  Why can't it work the first time?I constantly had the urge to use the white part of the device as a touch screen, but only the bottom is a touch screen.  I found myself thinking, my iPod Touch is better than this.  It is fast to touch what I want.  Give me something better like a Blackberry pointer ball!Display is flashing every time a page is changed.  I found this constantly annoying.  Why?  There is no reason for the flashing.  EVERY PAGE FLASHES AT YOU!  YOU WILL LEARN TO HATE IT!!!!USB power connector.  This is a weak spot of the device.  Instead of using a robust connector, they use a micro USB connector. It is wobbly. Even a mini-USB would have been better.  At times I  could not make this connector work.  It is delicate.  It doesn't want to mate up.  I found I needed to be very precise on aligning it, even then it would not connect.  I doubt that this will survive 100 re-connections.  If you buy this device, do not expect it to last more than two years.  It would be smart to get the extended warrantee--another $60 for two years--If you buy a nook.  Charge it only when you have too, or you will wear out this connector in a short period of time.  While the battery life is good, given the crappy connector, I don't understand why they didn't put a battery 2-3 times larger in this device so that the connector would last longer and have less wear.Memory Storage is limited to about 1GB with space to add another memory card.  To bring it up to 8 or 16 GB, it will cost you another $30 to $60, or if you buy it from B&N; it will be twice as much.  I feel the device is worthless without at least another 8GB of storage.  I'd rather it came with another 16GB.  The iPad comes with that much or more--so you get a color full touch screen for not much more than the cost of the memory you need.This is a good gift for someone clueless about electronics that won't know any better about how badly B&N; crippled their android operating system and don't understand what a good interface is all about.Do yourself a favor.  Try an iPod Touch, and I assume the iPad works as well.  Apple makes quality products that work right, with strong connectors, great software, and are backed up with the highest rated customer support.  B&N; built something with one purpose only, to sell electronic books--and to make it difficult to find free books, and to break quickly.  If you want to be screwwed over, buy one of these and then bend over because B&N; sees you as someone to be used and abused--not a valuable customer.If B&N; made it easy to download free books, I'd be more forgiving on the crappy software they use and the delicate power connector.  If B&N; made a decent, usable interface, and made it easy to load whole library's of free books, I'd probably buy some electronic books and they would earn my business.  As it is, I will never buy an e-Book or any other book from B&N.;  That is how angry I am about wasting money on this product.My nook is dead after only three days.  I wish I could return it.  I don't have the original packaging either, so that even if I got a new replacement, I cannot sell it on eBay to get my money back.  I'm not sure what I'll do.  I will be calling B&N; tomorrow to see about a replacement, and begging for a store credit instead so I can buy an iPad instead.The bottom line is, I'm more than disappointed about the product.  I'm angry enough that I'll never do business with B&N; again--even if they refund me the price of this device.  I don't even want it back if it were repaired.I'd rather pay $600 for an iPad, purchasing from a company that charges a lot for products that are well thought out and work well.  While I may wish the price was less for Apple products, at least I don't have this awful feeling of being screwwed ten different ways by B&N; with their service and nook product.For those who think this is a good product.  You are fools who don't know enough to make a valid judgment.  I laugh at you, because your nook will be dead within a year.,
","I have had my eBookman for over a year now and I have read all of the reviews on this site and others. The pros and cons seem to be pretty accurately stated by other reviewers so I will not waste anybody's time repeating what has already been said. However, there seems to be something which has been missed in other reviews. What I've noticed is that most other reviewers seem to be avid readers who use their eBookman's everyday. And for those users, the complaint that I have is probably simply a minor annoyance. But for users like myself who bought the eBookman for the occassional business trip or long flight, there is a ridiculously inconvenient feature that makes it almost impossible to use. That is, if you leave your eBookman off for any extended period of time, the batteries continue to drain until they are completely dead! Yes, you heard me. THIS UNIT USES UP THE BATTERIES EVEN WHEN IT IS OFF. For example, I would regularly put in a fresh set of batteries and within 3 weeks they would be completely dead (without ever having turned on the unit). At first, I thought there was something wrong with my unit. But a call to Franklin's technical support confirmed my worst fear: This is the way the units were designed!But, wait - I haven't even gotten to the punch line yet! When the batteries run out, all of the data is lost - INCLUDING THE OPERATING SYSTEM. This is because the unit has no internal battery back-up. It just uses a capacitor which only holds a smal charge for a few seconds (supposedly just long enough to change batteries when the battery indicator is running low). But if your batteries run out, it's BYE-BYE data! So, for the casual user, what that means is that you end up having to re-install the entire operating system and all of your titles every time you turn the unit on (assuming you do not use it an a VERY regular basis). This, by the way, is no short task (although, in fairness to Franklin, it is a simple process). For me, this problem renders the eBookman TOTALLY USELESS. Now, I'm sure there are avid readers or frequent travelers who would love to have what otherwise would be classified as a pretty decent reader for a very decent price. But, for me, it is just a paperweight.In summary, if you use the eBookman everyday, I guess you could find a use for it. But if you plan to let it rest - even for a relatively short period of time - I would look elsewhere.,
","UPDATE: 05/24/12Okay so after trying several other radios (Kaito K200, C.Crane Solar Observer) I feel like Panasonic did not really step up with this product as much as it could have:1) The reception on this product is not as good as it could have been. If you want something with a better reception get a portable Sony.2) The red ban on the dial is tilted sideways. I don't know if it is only my product but it gets pretty annoying after while.Otherwise if you care about a decent FM radio and okay AM radio then this a product for you. However given that SONY ICF-S10 has much better reception and is cheaper, then there is no reason to go with Panasonic. Unless of course you like the looks, in that case Panasonic might be the winner.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So my first impression was - this radio looks quite nice! I like the size to sound quality compromise. The speaker is entire width of the radio. The size of the radio is large enough to give good sound and small enough to fit into back pocket and use it outside. The FM reception is good enough for the radio to be used with antenna retracted. The antenna is also screwed in so if you do break it, you can simply attack a copper wire for replacement. And you won't be shipping the radio under warranty because shipping is more expansive than the radio itself.As for AM reception it is also very good, I pick up tons of stations in NYC and most of them clearly. There is a little red diode that indicates when you have maximum signal strength, it's quite useful. The battery life, is like most small radios amazing.Quality control seems good. There is no loose parts, no dents and no scratches. The only downside is the red station indicator. It's not mounter perpendicular to the analog dial. This is quite annoying because whenever I change stations it flops to the right a little bit. Im not sure if this is quality control issue or by design there is only one string pulling it left or right.,
"
90,"Despite all of the negative reviews, I decided to take a chance and buy the nook, once I tested it out at my local B&N.; I loved the look and feel of this device and was looking forward to the convenience of buying more books without adding more clutter to my already cluttered bookcases. I read all of the pros and cons of owning a Kindle and compared it to the pros and cons of owning a nook. The nook won because of its versatility (epub format, book lending, etc).My nook arrived on January 28th. Since then, I've experienced one crash and had to figure out how to use the touchscreen so that I can flip the pages without having to use the arrow keys. The latter took some practice, but I eventually mastered it and have been enjoying this feature ever since. I've also read three books in the space of a week, which is a personal record for me, as it normally takes two weeks for me to read a single paperback, longer if I'm reading an ebook on an LCD screen.The eInk technology is fabulous. I can read all day (and do) without eyestrain. The letters are very crisp on a plain white background. Even better, you can adjust the font size from small to extra large. Not only that but the nook comes with several fonts: Amasis, Helvetica Neue and Light Classic. I'm happy with the Amasis as it resembles Times Roman.My only complaint so far is that I am not able to categorize my books into categories. At the moment, I'm forced to wade through my list until I find the book that I want to read. B&N; has already sent out an update, which is a good improvement over the old interface. While the touch interface can be a bit buggy (Sometimes you have to flick your finger more than once or use the arrow keys to turn the page.), I can turn pages in one second compared to the 2-3 seconds it would take with the original software. That wasn't a big deal until I received the upgrade.I also like what they've done with the bookmarks feature. Before, they had a strange numerical format for bookmarks. With this upgrade, it lists the page that you bookmarked, which is much nicer.I love how I can download samples of ebooks directly from my nook without having to rely on the B&N; site to do everything. Once you finish the sample, you have the option to buy. If you decide to buy the book, you will be taken to the last page you read so that you can continue from there. You can also archive the books that you've read directly from your nook with the press of a button, which helps manage your list.Sideloading my pdf ebooks onto my nook was an easy experience. However, you can't categorize your documents; you can only sort them by title or author.Another great aspect of owning a nook is that you can check out ebooks from your local libraries (see [...] for a list of libraries near you), sideload books that you have bought from Fictionwise and other ebook stores, and download free ebooks from either the B&N; site or Google Books. That's what ultimately sold me on the nook, the versatility and freedom to choose where I want to buy or download free ebooks. The nook is not proprietary, unlike the Kindle and the soon-to-be-released iPad.The interface is very easy to use. It comes with a manual that you can read on the device, or on the B&N; website. If you're still stuck on an issue, I found this great forum ([...]) with friendly people who can help you.I've yet to check out the Lend feature because my family and friends have yet to embrace this technology.Other than my issue with organization, I am really enjoying my nook. I'm looking forward to reading many books in the future, thanks to this wonderful device. Highly recommended.Side note: I agree with S. Dayton about the iPad. After reading a few ebooks on my iTouch and my Mac, I have to agree with him about the eyestrain. For casual surfing and watching video, LCD works fine. But for longterm reading, eInk is the way to go.,
","I have been using my Palm VIIx about a week now and definitely like it. As a deaf individual, the wireless email is as close as I can get to being on an equal footing with cell phone users. The service plans offered by Palm.net actually appear to be cheaper than service plans offered by Skytel.com for their Motorola text paging devices. The ideal solution for me would be a cell phone costing not more than $50 with a monthly service plan of not more than $10 and no data transfer charges. It would send and recieve text messages and surf the web anywhere in the world and talk to any wireless network, anywhere, for exactly the same price. We don't have price/performance like that yet. So I took the VIIx because I was impatient for wireless email. Now I have a minimally frustrating way of getting in touch with family while I'm on the road. It's really nice being able to carry all 427 of my contacts and a few tons of notes in a 6 ounce package. Is it worth my [$]? I am willing to pay that much just for the wireless email. (wireless web clippings appear to be well beyond my financial means at this time.) As for the rest of the device I don't know its true worth to me yet and suspect I  will not for several more months.Linux users, you can HotSync a Palm to a Linux machine. Look for the pilot-link software for your distribution and be sure to check the O'Reilly web site for their Palm articles. Pilot-link, however, is focused on a serial HotSync connection. How about a little USB software too? There is for Red Hat users, but it is not targeted expressly for the Palm. If you have Red Hat 7.0 look carefully in your kernel sources for a module named visor.c. Open it in emacs and you'll discover it is USB-support code for HotSyncing a HandSpring Visor. Methinks with just a little work it can be ported to the Palm also, since the 2 devices use the Palm OS.The Palm VIIx has fairly severe limitations:1. The Hotsync cradle ought to ship as USB hardware with a true USB interface just as the Handspring devices do. My desktop computer only has one free serial port and that is in use for my modem. (That's a tipoff that I'm a Linux user.) Few new computers have more than one RS-232 (serial) port. Old computers had 2 or 3, but new ones usually give you just one and a bunch of USB ports. Since a serial cradle ships standard, I may have to spend another $40 for the USB connector. (I'm thinking I might be able to go to CompUSA and pick up a serial port card for a lot less than the Palm USB kit. Is there such a card? Hmmm.) I think a USB option should be offered to Palm users free.2. It should be easy to connect to a home network but is not. The VIIx is just another computing device. If you can hook it into a Windows or Linux based network, either with an ethernet cable connection or wirelessly, you can surf the web on a (far cheaper) landline connection without needing Palm.net. Palm OS 3.5.2 has TCP/IP code for making network connections. The interfaces Palm documents are through a serial (PPP, SLIP or CSLIP) connection. That means a hardware-based connection. I can assign the device an IP address or it can use DHCP. I should also be able to assign a hostname like 'bobspalm.lingpgmr.com'. But wait a minute! I'd like to sit down on my sofa (with a strong overhead light) and literally tap the VIIx into a wireless network connection to my home network. That must be possible because the handbook documents how to change the IP address of the proxy server, and there is now or soon will be wireless ethernet connectivity hardware available for the home.I should have a relatively easier time turning the Palm into a PPP-based network client in Linux than in Windows. But I would still be tied to the Hotsync cradle instead of relaxing on my easy chair and checking my stock account.3. The Palm OS seems brain-damaged. For example I can only have ShortCuts of up to 45 characters in length each. Why that limitation? Why not 1K or more to each ShortCut? That way I can use ShortCuts to help fill in boilerplate text entries in DateBook or my To Do's. I'm limited to how many categories I can have as well. Why impose such arbitrary limitations? I might need 80 or 100 or 250 or 500 categories. The person next door might need 1250. That's flexibility. Memos and Notes are limited to 1K in length each. If you sync to Outlook 2000, an Outlook Note can be 32K long. There goes your notes if they are longer than 1K. Contacts in Outlook 2000 can have a large number of fields such as &quot;Nickname&quot; that the conduit will throw away no matter how badly I want access to them. What happens then? You suddenly find yourself reinventing the wheel, spending your valuable time paring existing data to fit the handheld platform when it really ought to be exactly the other way around: the handheld should accept whatever is thrown at it from the desktop application so that you can press that button and go. Instead of finding yourself with a mirror image of a desktop database you have 2 very different databases and each requires time to customize. What a waste. I think this is the fault of the Palm OS and very shortsighted design decisions. If you must reinvent the wheel someone was stupid somewhere.4. I agree with all the other complaints made by others. The screen especially is very hard to see and use. I hate the greyscales and the reflectiveness of the screen and the difficulty of writing Grafitti. You have to be really determined to enter a lot of text using Grafitti.Complaints like these plus the presence of the Handspring platform may work to bring some humility to the Palm folks and convince them to make the Palm much more user and network friendly. If you are considering buying this device, waiting a year or so might not be a bad idea.,
","I bought a set of these for someone that has problems wearing earbuds (IEM), as well as staying away from my JVC-HAFX67B. These phones are perfect for the pc or laptop if you're looking for a 'quick' and simple device to catch news-feeds or watching tutorial videos. Please note that these are not noise-canceling headphones, but for the price with shipping, you really can't go wrong and they are pretty comfortable around your ears!About the phones:Works well with computers but I wouldn't recommend tagging it along with your portable music device -- such as an iPod. The reason being is that they do not do a very good job of suppressing or isolating sounds, which means you can still hear ambient noise and people sitting around you can also hear them. The earcups are designed at an angle facing inwards from the front (shaping your ears) and out towards the rear, this is good for people with flappy ears, but not for me and probably the majority. To get the full sound I'd have to press and hold them in flat, the XBS Bass effect works well but all other frequencies quickly becomes muddled, and surely one can't be doing this all along while wearing it.In retrospect, sound quality is decent, from a scale of 1 to 10 (being best) I'd say 6. You can hear the Bass but you won't feel it, it is there, only not as rich and tight. The Trebles could be better if it weren't for the Mids being a bit too high which resulted to somewhat of an overall 'flat' sounding device.Back to the design as I mentioned before, the angled-cup design could be a small problem to some people. It is certainly for me because this also reduces the overall volume decibel compared to my uber-rich soundingJVC HAFX67Bwhich at 25% volume level, I get a fairly high sound decibel as apposed to 50% level with the Panasonic. Also, I didn't like the angle plug, this could be a plus or minus to some. The reason: when it's plugged in to my Nano next to its charging socket, the angle-plug prohibits me to lay the Nano down on a flat surface, or I'd have to swivel the plug opposite but it'll stick up in the air (see my photos). In case you're asking, it CAN'T be swiveled to the sides because it is very tight with the charger plugged in, if I try, it WILL bend and damage the socket and phone jack plugs!Pros:Price, price and price (under 5 bucks)!Free shippingDecent soundBass (okay, but not rich or tight)Cons:Ear cup designAngled Plug (may or my not be for others)Flat soundingSound escapes even at decent volume levels,

91,"After MONTHS of research for my first ereader I finally decided on the Nook. With all the buzz, I, of course, ran out to BN to see the Nook when it first came out and was incredibly disappointed at that time as it was painfully sluggish and I had almost crossed it off my list for purchase. However, I went back and saw it again at the store after about 6 weeks from my first viewing and what a difference! Barnes and Noble has made great strides. A friend showed me her Kindle and I got to play with it and I looked in stores and saw the Sony reader as well. Did MUCH research online as well on some of the others such as Jetbook Lite.As much as I LOVE Amazon and shop here more often than I probably should LOL. I decided on the Nook seeing the improvements that were already made in that short amount of time. What sealed the deal for me was the SD card option to expand memory AND you can change the battery yourself as opposed to having to send your device back over a simple battery change.I am not regretting my decision to go with the Nook at all. I have to admit that it did freeze up on me twice, BUT it only did that when I interrupted the charging process. So, I don't know exactly what caused that. No problems at all while reading. As far as reading on the Nook, its a great device. Downloading books is fast and simple to do. Page turning is fast now. Its a dream come true for an avid reader like me.The only con that I've noticed so far is battery life. I think its a huge stretch to say the battery lasts 10 days. However, the wi-fi turns itself off after being idle for a minute or so, so you don't have to manually turn it off. When you activate the menu, it will reconnect to the network. So, BN is making an effort to increase battery life without much manual interaction.I highly recommend the Nook. With BN updates coming as quick as they are, I think this device is proving to be THE superior ereader.,
","I originally purchased the standard Nikon bag which by the way holds nothing and quickly found out that I needed something a bit larger and could carry more than just the camera.  While I was a little disappointed with the bag at first i think it is just what i need at this point in photog life.  The picture from the manufacturer is a bit misleading.  Bottom line, it won't hold a lot of stuff but thats not to say it's too small.  Here is a list of my pros and cons:Pros:1. Scalability.  The M.A.S. and S.A.S. attachments are where this bag excels at.  While it won't hold everything at first it can definitely grow as you collection does.2. Rain flap.  This flap is not as cumbersome as some would have you believe.  It can get in the way but that is why we have two hands and opposing thumbs.....just move it over.3. Configurable inside and out.  You can move the dividers around to suit your needs and there are more straps on the outside to attach things than Carter has peanuts.4. Well cushioned which means your prized possessions are in good hands.5. Well constructed.  Stitching is great and no signs of it going to wear out in the forseeable future.Cons:1. The pockets in the front flap are almost laughable.  They won't hold much but thats not to say they can't hold what they were intended to, pen cleaner, maybe a notepad, extra batteries, a usb cable, and some memory cards.2. Super long shoulder straps.  I have no idea who is expected to carry this thing but the straps could have been a bit shorter.  BTW they do adjust....I'm just griping. :)All in all, this is a good little bag that can grow as your collection does and is perfect for the photog that needs more than just a camera bag.,
","Okay, I realize that these are very inexpensive headphones, but I had hopes for them.I usually just use typical iPod ear buds for regular use and a couple of brands of over-the-ear headphones for holding in place during running and strenuous workouts.  My plan for these headphones was for using while outside working in the lawn with mowers and other machinery running.  I realized that they wouldn't silence other sounds in the way that the much heavier, fully padded/insulated headphones do...but I had expectations of them being able to deaden outside noises as much or more than regular ear buds.  I was reluctant to wear the heavier headphones that completely surround your ears while outside working since I didn't want to completely tune out what was happening around me.It didn't take long to come to the conclusion that they offer nothing at all in the way of outside sound reduction.  The in-your-ear buds cover outside noise better than these do.  So, I thought...oh well, I'll just use them for regular indoor listening.  They're certainly comfortable enough.  But, they don't stay on...or at least they don't stay on me.  I have to remain perfectly motionless or else they slide off my ears.The sound clarity is decent for the price.  The cable is plenty long at about 4.5.'  The XBS port is supposed to offer increased bass response.  I maybe noticed a bit of difference there; but it's of little help when the headphones won't stay in place on my ears.,

92,"First let me say that when the Nook first came out on the market it caught my eye. I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.Then the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.Right out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...Now with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.Now with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews. Well back to my Nook, as I can not put it down!What a great gift, and a great buy!!!,
","I was looking for a backpack upgrade after finding my over-the-shoulder bag too small to hold a two lenses, film, a filter wallet, and a cleaning kit for my Nikon N6006, (which is an average sized SLR). The Tamrac Expedition 3 disappointed me for several reasons:(1) Too small -- the bag is NOT the size of an average backpack; it is about 40% smaller, and closer to a shoebox in profile.  There is no room for lens hoods.  Even the slack from the camera strap causes space problems when trying to zip/unzip the bag.  Tamrac certainly could have made this bag much more functional had it been the size of a standard backpack.(2) No room for film -- upon buying the bag, I found out that it requires a film holster accessory in order to hold film (sold separately).  The other alternative is to leave a lens behind and use that space instead.(3) Inadequate space for filters -- a filter wallet will fit in the front pouch with a bit of finagling.  But they are somewhat unprotected, and if a tripod is mounted on the outside, it will be applying pressure on this space and compromising the filters.(4) Slow access due to hard to open zippers -- the fabric and zippers are stiff and difficult to unzip and access.  Spontaneous quick-reaction photography is nearly impossible if your camera is packed away.This bag is a great idea without a market:  it's far too big for a point-and-shoot camera, but far too small to carry the standard accessories any SLR photographer would normally keep.  I strongly recommend looking at other options, and do carefully compare dimensions.,
","I gave these a 3 star rating but only because of the low price, otherwise a 1 or 2.Pros:Lightweight (but what headphones in this class aren't?)Cheap ( but what &#34; ... )Top band and slider rails appear to be made of HDPE plastic which is more flexible, won't become as brittle over time to reduce # of areas likely to break, and yet the top band would be even more durable made of spring metal and then it could hold an adjustment for optimal tension to suit your head sizeFair amount of bass for the cup size and price, not especially boomy, not out of control bass trying to make up for the shortcomings of a small driver and thin/light low volume plastic cupsFair cord length for portable use, ought to be 1' shorter for that but the extra 1' might help if your source is in a bag rather than a pocket nearer your head.90' plug doesn't stick up as far on portable players so they seem less bulky and there's less stress to the headphone jackFairly conservative design, no silly colors or shapes for niche artistic styling that not everyone would like, rather than the purpose of headphones.  They don't look &#34;as&#34; cheap as some in the same price class.Foam cushions are a little higher density than some, letting them sit closer to your ears.You won't care much if you break them or if they are stolen, except then you have no cans till you find a replacement.Cons:Lightweight - They have that empty tin can sound accentuating upper midrange, and they could have put a bit more plastic into the pieces that hold the cups only the adjustment sliders for more durabilityNo strain relief on the wires where they exit the cups.  If you coil your cord up for storage during portable use, you will find this to be one of the early failure modes.Clunky size adjustment, the notches in the HDPE rails are large and HDPE doesn't mold into distinct notches as well as other plasticsPre-molded angle on cups seems a little large compared to many cans, if your ears don't stick out a lot you may find they don't sit as flush against your ears as many cans despite the slight amount of swivel present, which results in loss of hearing much of the lower midrange and bassWhile the bass is fairly controlled for this price,  their marketing dept. fails with the feature &#34;XBS port&#34; because the bass is fairly poor relative to almost any (even slightly) larger cupped cans.  Small, light and portable is good but if you can accept an ounce of weight and a few millimeters size increase there are huge bass improvements to be had on cans with only slightly larger cups, and yet the price on those goes up some too.Although they are inexpensive, it would only cost a few cents more to make them more durable and improve the sound quality.  This seems like a false economy to me, my body and gear weigh dozens of pounds so why is shaving fractions of an ounce off their weight so important?  It isn't, this is just about saving a few cents in manufacturing cost at the expense of the aforementioned details.Overall:It's tempting to pick a product based on the lower price, but often you only get what you pay for.  Yes you could pay the same for inferior cans but don't let some of the more positive reviews fool you, these don't sound good at all relative to cans costly only a few dollar more.  They sound only slightly better than any $2 generic cans you can find anywhere.Despite all the pros I listed, they just don't meet the core purpose of providing good audio.  It is distracting how terrible they sound.  To be fair I would write the same about any $5 cans I've ever heard but on most I didn't see so many positive reviews that misled me into hoping these were different when they aren't.For a reference point, many consider me an audiophile.  My standards seem to be higher than average, but I'm not an elite snob about certain makes and models.  I've owned many a pair of cans and build some of my own audio gear and modify the rest.  Even so I am not trying to compare these against $40 cans, let alone more costly pairs.  They just don't sound good enough to use even if they were free, unless you're only listening to audible books or similar voice.  I would have returned them except that they are so inexpensive that it wasn't worth the bother.,
"
93,"I got my Nook Wi-Fi/3G about 2 months ago, and I love it!  I researched ALOT of ereaders before making the decision to buy the Nook; in fact, I originally bought a Kindle from a local store, but never took it out of the box, and returned it to purchase the Nook.I originally decided to go with the 3G for two reasons; 1) I wasn't sure I could set up my home wi-fi to work with the Nook, and 2) I wanted to be able to purchase books from absolutely anywhere.  And I've been glad I chose that; I have yet to purchase a book over just the wi-fi.  I was at a doctors office recently, waiting and waiting and waiting, and it was wonderful to be able to shop, buy a book, and start it while enduring the endless waiting.The customer service from Barnes and Noble is great, all I have to do is walk in the store with my Nook and the employees are knowledgable and helpful for helping with the Nook.  Also, the store nearest me has ""classes"" on Saturday afternoons for Nook/NookColor owners, and I found that to be very helpful when I first purchased my Nook.Speaking of the physical store, I also like that I can read any book for FREE for up to an hour a day in the store.  That gives me the opportunity to read alot more of a book than just what they provide as a ""free sample"" and lets me decide whether to purchase the book or not.I've looked at the newest generation Nook, which has just recently become available, and I'm glad I got my Nook when I did; I like it so much better than ANY ereader I've looked at.  I can drop my nook in my purse, and anytime I'm stuck somewhere and want to read, I've got a whole library right there with me.  The Nook is awesome!!!,
","I've had 30 days to live with this thing extensively, and I thought I'd share with you what I've found out.  The rating is really 4.5 stars, but I just can't give it a perfect score for the price they are asking.The Jukebox is excellent for what it does, which is put every CD you own at your fingertips.  You should know yourself if you have a use for this or not.  The Jukebox is perfect in the car or at work, where it is unfeasable to bring 100 CDs along.  You don't have to change CDs, and you can edit the playlists to reflect your tastes at any given moment.  When I was sick for a week, I had my complete collection at my bedside.  Long trips would also be an excellent time for the Jukebox.Seek time between songs is about the same as the pause between songs on a CD.  The hard drive inside makes noise, but I wasn't distracted by it.  The case is exactly the size of a portable CD player, and only an ounce or two heavier.  The Jukebox is Creative's flagship model, so everything is high quality.  The package includes a nice carrying case, excellent-sounding headphones (which are a bit tight), extra batteries, all the cables, etc.If you have extremely sensitive ears, don't expect any MP3 player to have true CD audio quality.  This is a compressed audio format, so you get what you pay for.  I love the sound quality, but a recording studio technician might hate it. And don't expect to take this jogging.  Although it can be done, the Jukebox is certainly not made it.  It is designed to be used on a desktop, plugged into the wall.Unfortunately, the battery life is way too short.  You will need to buy a power adapter for every location you use the Jukebox regularly. (i.e. home, work, the car...)  Carrying around the power cord defeats the purpose of portability.  A power cord for the car is not included.Lastly, the price of the Jukebox (and MP3 players in general) is way to high.  Be careful that it doesn't get stolen.And the final test - I use this everyday!  I love it.  Navigation is easy, everything is easy.  I certainly got my money's worth.,
","When I was purchasing other items that I wanted/needed, I came up short on getting the $25 minimum for getting the free shipping.  I was only a few cents short and I didn't want to have to spend another $3 to $5 in shipping, so I began to look around for little things that I would have considered nice to have just so that I could get another item for that money.  I was very lucky to stumble upon these headphones as they have quickly become my favorite item from that group purchase.  What I thought would have been just a nice, keep to the side just in case item, have become my favorite headset to use on the computer and I use them everyday.These Panasonics were incredibly cheap when I purchased them (around that $3-5 range) but the quality and sound they have are incredible for that price point.  I have not had a problem with discerning any kind of sound from videos, games, sound effects, etc. They are also very comfortable as the ear portions can slide very far to fit a variety of different head sizes.  The cord is also a good length so that you have a decent amount of room to work with in leaning down from the computer jack or using with an iPod.I have had no complaints using these headphones and, to be honest, am very surprised at just how good they are.  You can't go wrong with these headphones and especially at the price, consider them a great bargain instead of cheap knock offs.,
"
94,"I have been super happy with this reader.  In the bright sun sitting outside, no problem.  On the many flights I take, no problem.  B&N; site and downloading books is a breeze.  I've got a Droid X phone, and the accounts sync, so I can quickly pull up the same book on my phone with the Nook App, very cool.I can lend, and have others lend me, some of the books purchased.Our local library in Central Texas, outside Austin, is connected to Overdrive.com.  With my library card I can download epub books and check them out, anywhere I've got internet.  I don't have to check them back in, they just go away after the check out period.  Same with Audiobooks.  Nook handles this format, other eReaders do not, so you might want to look into this option and what formats the readers have before making a decision.I like the onscreen keyboard/touch screen, personally.  It is bright and easy in areas where dimly lit and the light in your reader case is directed at the reading screen.  Seems like no big deal, but after 28 hours on a plane you get tired and this makes a difference.Not a bunch of keys to hit/press with the keyboard exposed.  This is a personal opinion, and I can absolutely understand why others may want the keyboard.  I put in pagemarks etc on books, but don't type a lot of notes into the ebooks when reading.  If you do a lot of this, you may want to test run the onscreen keyboard and see if you like it.  I don't, the amount of typing is very limited, so onscreen is perfect and I'm used to it with my phones.Using this over wifi to surf the internet is something you can do, but it isn't the best.  You can in a pinch, but it's easier for me to pull out my smartphone and crank into a website.The number of places to get books, especially free ones, is awesome with the Nook handling so many formats.  B&N; just search 0.00 and titles and you'll get thousands of classics come up that copyright is over and they are free.  gutenberg.org is puts free classics by the tens of thousands out that you can download onto your Nook for free, google books does this and a few other sites.  Tons and Tons of books for free, I haven't read Tom Sawyer in 20+ years and am now, for free.  Just an addition to note.Lots of periodicals, newspapers etc, that you can get daily.I take my kids into B&N; and they love to look through the kids books.  While there, I can read any book over their Wifi for free for up to an hour.  I don't use this a lot, but once a month or so when I take the kids, it's pretty cool.Overall, I'm really pysched, this Nook has been awesome.,
","The Nomad Juke Box is by no means the perfect solution to mass storage of MP3s on a mobile unit.The Downsides:1) Battery Life: It's only four hours! So, you can store hundreds of hours of music on the thing, but only listen to four hours between charges; kind of lame. The good thing is that creative DOES include two sets of rechargeable batteries. That makes up for the low battery life.2) Size: This thing is heavy! It is, as Creative says, the &quot;size of a CD player.&quot; The size, yes, but not the weight! If you're thinking about going jogging (or even walking, really) with this thing, go buy something else. It 's just too big.3) The Hard Drive Deal: How creative could have stored 6 gigs on a portable player without a hard drive, I don't know, but the hard drive just doesn't work that well. There're the vibrations, the heat (it can get REALLY hot copying stuff to it), and the possibility of damage. I haven't dropped the thing, yet, but I imagine that if I did, it would not be good.The Upsides:1) The space, of course... lots of music 2) The organization software is pretty decent (I hate the SoundJam software for Mac, though)So, in summary, if you just NEED to have all your MP3s with you, this thing is great (as long as you can deal with the battery recharging). If you're looking to just play some MP3s on a jog, run, or in the car, go get a Rio (or a Nomad, if you like Creative--they're both fine).,
","Let me start by saying that these are my favorite style of headphones. I find ear-buds to be uncomfortable, and the sound to be of poor quality (no bass whatsoever and low quality high notes). The big ear-muff style headphones sound great, but I don't like how they look on me, nor do I like the fact that you can't hear any other noises (like someone trying to get your attention). They are also not really as good for wearing while doing something physical, such as jogging, and they are too big to be able to have them on while your head is sideways on a pillow or a chair, etc.But this style of headphones is a nice compromise right in the middle.In my experience for a couple months of frequent use of these headphones, with all kinds of music and audio, I have found them to sound very decent. Compared to other brands and models of this style of headphones that I have owned, these have a very decent amount of bass in them, significantly more so than my last pair, and the high notes also sound nice and clear. They fit well on my head too. For what they are, they do a very decent job.,
"
95,"I bought the original nook in Aug. 2010. Initially, I liked it, but I quickly learned that the battery life wasn't nearly the quoted time (it lasts about 2 days for me, 3 max with wireless off and the most power-saving settings). The e-ink/lcd screen mix was nice for navigation, although I understand that the newer touch models will be more battery-efficient. Despite this drawback, it was so much more convenient than paperbacks. As much as I love the feel of books, in a NYC apartment, there just isn't all that much room for them!That nook lived for about 9 months until a part of the screen died - just black pixels. I called customer service and after a long painful process, got it replaced. The unit I got was clearly a refurbished unit, which wouldn't have bothered me, had it been identical to the one I sent it. My original nook had a two-part screen, this new nook had a one-part screen and its' buttons squeaked when pressed. Little did I know at the time that this was the sign of a very important defect! As it happened, this 'squeaking', which made the buttons difficult to press, also caused the page-turn buttons to crack just one month past warranty. Needless to say, I wasn't delighted. Apparently, the page-turn buttons cracking is a very common defect. So if you buy a nook, remember this: if the button squeaks and is hard to press, it will break. Return it while you can. Not all the nooks are like this (my old one wasn't), so I recommend checking it out.Overall - 3/5 - it's a solid reading device but doesn't really compare to the new-generation nook simple touch/kindle touch devices or even the Kindle 3 keyboard (which I now also own).,
","Okay, first off, the battery life is arguably the worst I've ever seen.  I think a non-waterproof watch at the bottom of a pool might run longer than this thing.  But I'm in no mood to test that.Secondly, the playlist navigation is almost a joke.  When in random mode or shuffle mode (yes, those are two seperate modes - how novel), skipping forward plays a new and completely unexpected song.  Good.  Skipping backwards however does NOT play the last song you heard.  No, it's essentially exactly the same as pressing the forward key.  What?!  Who thought this up?If you're thinking that isn't all that annoying - how about this?  If you shift from &quot;random&quot; or &quot;shuffle&quot; mode to &quot;once&quot; mode during song play, the device completely forgets what the heck is going on.  It will continue to play the active song, but display on the LCD panel the very first song on your playlist.  Next, it will play the second song, and the screen will catch up to itself.  Completely unacceptable.  It should continue to play AND DISPLAY the active song, and then proceed in order through your playlist from that point.Sigh.  Using this thing drives me crazy.  And mastering it's operation is almost self-defeating.  As you get better at being familiar with the intricacies of how to navigate the device, you can quickly advance to the point of being faster than the device.  Key response time needs help, and desperately.But, all in all, what do I think?  Well, I love it.  I mean, as long as I don't touch it or look at it, it's great.  It was designed to be listened to, and for that, well, wow, it really excells.  Songs sound amazing, and the idea of leaving my apartment with every CD I own, all in my pocket .. well, c'mon now .. that's just darn cool.  Creative needs desperately to get their act together with the firmware, but the hardware itself is definately worth the price.,
","I used to carry a laptop and a Franklin planner almost everywhere.  Now, my Jornada and the Targus keyboard are all I usually need, unless I'm doing a presentation to a client.  The Pocket PC is a marvel of convenience.  Here are common things I do on my HP Jornada:* All MS Outlook related activities (appointments, tasks, meeting notes, and contacts)* MS Pocket Money: I get a receipt, and I enter it before I leave the location.  No more piles of receipts to process at the end of the month so that I can reconcile my accounts.* Pocket Word: keep my personal journal, jot down notes, write business documents, etc.  The formatting isn't anywhere near as powerful as the desktop version of Word, but it won't take too many more features for this to be a highly functional word processor.* Pocket Excel: Track mileage.  Pocket Excel is a very basic spreadsheet, but it does a great job for simple spreadsheets.  I expect future versions will be better.* Download web pages for viewing: Using AvantGo, I routinely download the Economist, New York Times, CNN, and many other sites.  And if I travel, I can download restaurant and entertainment info for the city I go to.* Track billable hours: Using a great FREEWARE program for Pocket PC, I can track billable hours for clients, projects, and even activities associated with projects.* Brainstorm: I use a mind-mapping Pocket PC program to brainstorm and develop mindmaps and preliminary project plans for myself and with clients.* Listen to music: A 64MB flash card can hold a decent amount of MP3 files!* Show off my new daughter: I have a digital camera, so I can transfer images of my daughter to my Jornada to show pictures to my friends and associates.Additionally, with a Pocket PC, you can do many other things that I don't yet use the Jornada for, including view PowerPoint files, edit databases, edit html files, edit images, send and receive emails, view live Internet, watch mpg movies, and make cellular phone calls.  Great!The Jornada really has revolutionized my life.  That said, there are some cons (which is why I didn't give it 5 stars): 1) The biggest flaw is that the screen is virtually impossible to view in sunlight.  The Compaq iPaq's screens are much better.  2) The Windows OS is a bit clunky.  It's hard to exit programs or switch between programs.  I haven't seen the new Pocket PC 2002 OS to see if they've improved on this.The benefits far outweigh the flaws, however.  Pocket PCs are a great productivity tool, and the HP Jornada is a great product.,
"
96,"I bought a Nook today. The one and only reason I chose Nook (instead of just sticking with and upgrading my beloved old Kindle 1) is its ability to download books from the public library. Tomorrow I am taking the Nook back to Best Buy for a refund, not an exchange. The Nook is attractive and nicely packaged. I completely expected it to just work, like my Kindle did (and still does) and all of my Apple products do. But, like so many other reviewers here, my Nook never even got up and running before it croaked. First, it would not complete the registration process. I have an active account on B&N; and strong WiFi in my home, plus this Nook also has 3G so there were not any connection problems. Then, when I decided to just register later and moved on to explore how the Nook worked, it froze. Could not reboot or turn it off by holding down power key as suggested in the troubleshooting help/support on the B&N; website. It did not work. I do not want to mess with taking the back off, using little screwdrivers or whatever to take out (the fully charged) battery, etc. We should not have to do that on a brand new 200.00 product! So, am taking it back and won't buy another until they improve the quality of the thing. I never had one bit of trouble with my trusty Kindle, and would not even be looking at another brand of reader except for Kindle's inability to download library books.  I'm giving the Nook two stars instead of one because, if it actually worked, it looks like it would be a nice ereader and it has a more open format than Kindle does.Update: 1/28/11Went to return the Nook for a refund today and at the last minute decided to give it another go, so did exchange instead. Tonight charged and powered up the replacement Nook, so far so good. It works perfectly. Registration was smooth and fast, wifi connected easily with my signal, downloaded a book quickly, and navigation is a breeze.  No problems encountered yet except that it is not downloading an available firmware update, and there's probably some explanation for that so not a big deal.  So, I might just end up keeping this baby as a companion to my Kindle. Love having the Nook with its open format for library and other downloads. Will see how it holds up over the next several weeks and then update my rating accordingly.Update: 2/3/11Returned the Nook to Best Buy today and bought a Kindle 3 through Amazon. After exchanging the first defective Nook then using its replacement for several days I found that the device worked pretty much as it was supposed to. There are a couple of minor things about it that I was not crazy about and probably would have gotten used to, but there is one problem (design flaw?) that for me is definitely a deal killer. One of the minor annoyances is that there is a lot of screen flash during any menu change. Another is that the color, lighted touch screen control at the bottom of the device is distracting when it lights up at any touch during reading. And after a while I was not that crazy about the menu navigation either, seemed like too many steps and screen flashes, but probably could have gotten used to that too. I would not have rejected the Nook just over those little quirks. The big reason that the Nook was no way going to work out for me is, again, that touch screen display at the bottom of the device. It is, like an iPad, highly reflective. So what that means is that when the screen is off, which it is most all of the time during reading, you can watch yourself read! The black screen reflects anything in front of it, almost like a dark mirror. That was a no go for me, no I did not like it at all. Aside from these annoyances, the Nook did well at everything it was designed to do. So will upgrade the rating to reflect (haha) that. I have to say that I am much happier with the Kindle, but Amazon really needs to get with the program and let Kindle use the epub format. They will eventually lose me and a lot of other prospective customers over the epub problem, it is that big of a deal.Yet another update! 5/31/11Caved in and purchased another Nook last week. I still love my Kindle and prefer it over Nook, but just could not wait another minute for Amazon to open Kindle to ePub for downloading public library books. So, last week when B&N; had Nooks for sale cheap on their eBay website (99.00, free ship, 3g/wifi, non-color, refurb w/ full warranty) I jumped on it. This refurb Nook worked much better out of the box than my initial brand new device purchased then returned back in Jan/Feb. I am using the Nook just for library books, and it does what it's supposed to do. Navigation works well, but seems like it requires more step than Kindle. Still do not like the reflective color screen below the reading area. There is one thing that I do like better on Nook, the screen background is a paler gray than Kindle making for easier reading in low light. I will keep this Nook until Amazon does ePub, then stick with Kindle.,
","I had always wanted a macro lens but it wasn't on the top of my list. However, when Amazon had a superb deal on the price of this lens a few months ago, I snatched it up instantly.At first, being the novice I am, I wasn't too thrilled about the lens. As someone who WAS accustomed to pointing and shooting with my Rebel T3i, the lens was difficult to use, blurry and slow to focus and I had expected something more out of the most expensive lens in my amateur lens set-up. It took me some time to figure out how to work the lens but this only encouraged me to explore the camera and my photography in new ways.Some things I learned using this lens that will probably be beneficial to beginning photographers and those who are new to macro-photography:First of all, this lens works best with a good tripod if you are using it for its' macro capabilities. Once I learned that, it makes the lens much more enjoyable to use. I find that handheld and with autofocus on it can do portrait and landscape pictures decently. Handheld macro shots ARE possible but I personally find that there are not as sharp as when I use I tripod. There is a noticeable difference in sharpness... this lens can be insanely sharp!Secondly, the autofocus does not work that great for macro mode. This is not a bad thing. I usually turn off the autofocus and focus manually using the screen rather than the viewfinder and then use the digital magnification capabilities on my T3i to really sharpen the parts of the photo I want to focus on. I don't have a remote so I set the 2-second timer on my camera and take pictures that way. Without autofocus on, you can determine what areas of the the photo to highlight creatively and take advantage of its sharpness. This process may be a little slow and tedious for some people.Thirdly, it's not a microscope. I was initially disappointed that I could not stand inches away from an object and look at it's molecular breakdown. Haha. Shows my initial naivete but magnification capabilities from a distance allows you to photograph insects and animals without invading their space.I also use this shot for tripod telephoto shots. It can take some pretty amazing and sharp night shots (with a good tripod!) so I love that it is a very multipurpose lens despite being a macro lens.I love the USM motor. It is a bit slower than I expected but I assign that to the fact that it's a macro lens. It is super quiet and has introduced me to a level of quality beyond the kit and budget Canon lenses I have in my bag. For budget photographers, this can be a dangerous descent into lens acquisition syndrome.This lens definitely isn't for everyone. If you're a stubborn point and shooter with no desire/need for creative photography, this lens may not benefit you and will probably frustrate you. However, if you are willing to be patient and thoughtful, you can learn to make some amazing shots with this lens and expand your photographic creativity. If you dislike having to use a tripod and have money to splurge, there is the much more expensive L, image stabailization version of this lens.I also use this lens for my eBay listings and I feel that it really helps my items pop on the search results compared to competing listings. Highly recommended.,
","Moving to an area that doesn't have Palm VII coverage, I decided to buy a smaller &amp; lighter unit that had more RAM and better battery life. Maybe it isn't fair to compare the Visor to a Palm that cost twice as much, but here are the issues that I've had with the Visor during the first month:1) Difficulty installing USB driver on Windows 2000 (blew up during install).  Took some searching on message boards and Handspring's site to learn that I needed to download the latest version of the desktop (which includes the driver).  It also contained the clue I needed in order to remove the partially installed driver so that it would reinstall.2) Overall cheap feeling, and little silver flecks are already falling off the logo.3) The stylus is uncomfortably scratchy.  I usually use a Lamy or Rotring, but sometimes you just want to use the one that is included.  The Visor stylus is awful--sets my teeth on edge.  I swapped points with a Palm stylus, but this means that you are no longer carrying around a reset pin, which is a problem because...4) It locks up regularly, requiring resets at least once a week for me.  Once I have had to do a hard reset and reinstall everything from scratch.  The Palm needed resets sometimes too, but not this often.  (Fortunately, my CyberTool includes a stainless steel pin, as does the Swiss Card and most Victorinox knives with cork screws--get one to go with your retrofitted Visor stylus.)5) Sometimes you have to do a reset in order to get USB synch to work--even when the Visor appears to be operating normally.6) All my friends with Palms are using Ir to synch with W2K, but this is problematic with the Visor.  I did try Irlink, but still couldn't get it to work.  Visor tech report responded VERY quickly, explaining that I should try the new desktop software from Palm, which does have an Ir option (although it does NOT support USB, so it would be either/or).  I had actually tried this, because it was what the Palm owners are using, but I couldn't get it to work.  I don't want to give up USB also.7) No little ribbon to help pull out the batteries.  You have to dig around in there with a screwdriver or something--hard to get out with your thumb nail.8) The modules are kinda silly.  A vibrator? Hubba! A set of Star Trek books? I've never been able to finish an e-book on one of these little screens. The idea of the backup module isn't so bad, and maybe I'll need another 8 Meg someday. I loved the wireless on my VII, but the idea of a modem doesn't appeal to me because I always have my laptop.  I'd buy the GPS if it worked in Europe.  But it doesn't right now.  Maybe something cool will come out next year.So, the thing works OK, but if I had to do it again, I'd probably buy a Palm.  There doesn't seem to be an advantage to the Visor if you don't play with the modules. Maybe I'd feel differently if I'd bought some color other than Graphite?,

97,"Pros: eInk display preserves traditional reading experience and has great clarity and contrast. Reads PDF (both scanned and standard text) and EPUB book formats with no hassles or conversion required. In-store help and extra features from B&N.; Page turning speed is much improved with most recent update. Android OS allows for almost unlimited software improvements and added features. Replacement batteries can be bought and installed easily. Accepts SD cards for increased storage capacity (this really comes in handy if you want to use the device as an mp3 player or for audiobooks).Cons: eInk display requires you to operate at a bit slower pace than the touchscreen alone would allow. (Also: Not sure why the price from this supplier is abnormally high?)I've played with an iPad and it's a very fun device. But what I don't like is a glowing backlit screen, as I look at a monitor all day. When I read, I want to relax and give my eyes a break, and that's why I prefer eInk displays.The Nook's primary advantage over the Kindle is that it allows you to read EPUB and PDF books (scanned or text; either works) and buy books from various online ebook stores, including the Sony Reader store. This has already allowed me to read two titles that I wouldn't have been able to get for the Kindle. It also works very easily with Adobe Digital Editions software, a huge plus. Currently Amazon offers some titles that B&N; does not (a very temporary state of affairs, I suspect), but those are usually available from Sony.Add the book loan feature, free library books, and the ability to take it to a B&N; store for bonus features, and this unit pretty much stomps the Kindle and Sony readers.The Nook is a little slower than a phone or your other electronic devices due to the e-Ink screen, but once you get used to it, the device seems very smooth. In fact, I find that having to slow down a little actually helps me relax, and once you master turning pages with a quick brush of the thumb across the touchscreen, reading with the Nook is a very pleasant experience. I now prefer it to reading books in print, to be perfectly honest.,
","I honestly felt compelled to write this after reading many of the other reviews.  It seems that everyone out there rating the product high has &quot;just got it this morning&quot; and everyone else seems to be complaining about repairs and such.Well, my case is different.  I bought my Nomad II MG a little over a year ago along with a friend of mine.  We got them at the same time, from the same store and with an extra 64MB (total 128MB).I use the unit every day while going to and from the office (at least 2 hours a day).  In my experience, the battery will not last more than 5-6 hours (they say 8).  Having said that, I have not had to replace the battery.Let me get the bad out of the way first...- The buttons are extremely sensitive.  After a while, I wound up locking up the unit and just let it run on random.- Random logic seems &quot;not so random&quot;.- Controls are not intuitive and take some getting used to.- SmartMedia card will sometimes stop working.  Shutdown, remove and replace usually solves this.- The headphones are horrible!  Extremely uncomfortable!  I wound up buying Sony Phonotopia.- There was a shutdown problem while docked which was solved when I upgraded firmware.If after reading the previous list you think I hate this unit, think again...  I love it!This unit is extremely light, small and portable.  You can carry it in a shirt pocket.  Easy to carry in any season.If you get the 128MB total, you have an average 2 hours of music to go along with you.  Got tired of the same music?  Switch to the FM tuner and you're good to go. (or switch to 96kbps sampling rate and cram more songs in)This unit has great sound.  I also found it to be loud enough for my taste.  I always use sound level at 30 (50 max).For the record, the sync software is very easy to use...My friend has had the same experience with this MP3 player as I have.  We're both very happy with it and I would buy it again in a heartbeat.,
","I've been watching the digital market waiting for interchangable lens digitals to fall below that magic thousand dollar price point for some time. Although it's probably going to happen soon, I realized I still needed a simple point and shoot digital with decent resolution that ddn't cost an arm and a leg- with casmera getting cheaper every few months I didn't want to spend too much on a camera I might be replacing in a year. Still, I wnated something with more than enough resolution for high-quality web pictures, and maybe even 4x6 prints, which meant around 1.3-1.5 megapixels.I also decided I wanted a simple, removable media with no moving parts, and some degree of manual exposure control. It looked like I couldn't find what I really wanted under $500- and then I found the Fuji.I've been shooting this marvelous package for a week now, and it's lived up to my expectations in every way. Focusing is fast and accurate, with an optional macro range for closeups. Color accuracy is first rate, contrast is superb, and the finished prints need very little, if any, correction.  Battery life is the best of any of the digital cameras I've tried- turn off the LCD monitor and a st of 4 AAs will last 450 shots! That's a lot better than my Agfa, which ate a pair of AAs with every 16 shots. The supplied software includes a program to download and manage pictures directly and a copy of Adobe's Photo Deluxe, which is looking moe nad more like Photoshop all the time.It's a measure of the camera's human engineering that I used it for a full day before I opened up the instruction manual. It's just that intuitive. Turn it on, and shoot. That's it. The zoom control falls right where you need it, under your thumb, and the opticla finder zooms with the lens. No need to turn on the LCD unless you want to edit in the camera or check a precise closeup shot. (You can also zoom in, crop, and do other edits on the image while it's still in the camera). If you want to take greater control, there are menus that let you vary exposure, flash behavior and many other variables as well.The supplied 4MB SmartMedia card holds 12 high resolution, standard compression shots. You can increase or reduce image compression to get higher quality or more pictures, and you can switch to a low-resolution mode when you need to squeeze a lot of pictures onto one card. The standard compression mode gives such good images that I wouldn't hesitate using high compression for web photos in order to double the card's capacity.I'd suggest a few accessories that I found made the camera easier to use.First, another SmartMedia card. A 16MB card (available for around $30) rives you 49 high-res, standard compresion shots- enough for a whole vacation for some. Second, an accessory SmartMedia reader. While you can download directly from the camera to your computer, an accessory reader (around $50 or less) works much, much faster, and saves camera batteries, too. Last, a small well-padded case with a strap, and preferably with multiple compartments. I carry mine in a Domke bag that has room for the camera, a couple of extra media cards, a cell phone, pens, pencils, the instruction book (there's a lot this camera can do I haven't even explored yet) and a set or two of spare batteries. I'm thinking of adding yet another SmartMedia card, too; with a 32MB card I'd have a total of about 160 shots, or the equivalent of between 5 and 6 rolls of standard film. Not bad.,

98,"I will continue to update this review as I discover new features of the Nook, so stay tuned folks!*****************************************************************************Updated 02/08/2010*****************************************************************************I've been using my Nook with the newest update (v 1.2) for a few days now.  This is the second update to the Nook since launch.  All I can say is THANK YOU Barnes & Noble!The LCD screen improvements alone are GREAT!  With better looking icons, more responsiveness, and a sleeker appearance -- it makes me think of that McDonald's commercial: I'm lovin' it!Several of the well documented issues have been fixed, such as losing bookmarks due to powering off the unit -- which as it turns out was the most cited problem for Nook bashers and haters alike.  Nook haters will also be disappointed that the battery life has been optimized too.All-in-all if you've been waiting for the minor 1.0 issues to be fixed prior to purchasing the Nook you will not be disappointed in this newest version.  And if you have been considering switching from the Kindle you would be well advised to do so at this point.*****************************************************************************Updated 01/31/2010*****************************************************************************This device is clearly the best option on the market today, with it's LCD touchscreen, Wi-fi, memory expansion capabilities, and so, so much more. Let's ""wade in the weeds"" and look at some of the features in detail:LCD TouchscreenSo far this is the only mainstream reader to offer a LCD screen of any kind. The Coverflow-like book cover listing is beautiful, elegant, and functional. With the newest update it is uber fast, intuitive, and responsive. Page turns are super easy with the touchscreen, all you have to do is swipe the screen with one finger when it's in standby mode and the page turns.  In addition, it's easier for me to navigate books via the LCD than textually. Seeing the cover is a really nice feature, since books are designed to pique your interest by the cover. It just seems like a good cover sells a book, and seeing that cover in crisp LCD sells me from time to time.The keyboard is nice, any time a text field comes up you will have the keyboard pop up on queue. It's fast, responsive, and best of all doesn't look like a 1970's era fax machine keypad like some of the older readers on the market.Wi-fiThe built in Wi-fi is one of the great features of this device. Modern 3G speeds are pretty fast, but as most of us know that have smartphones, Wi-fi is about 100 times faster, especially when one tries to download large things, or a lot of content. The Wi-fi on this device is no exception... it's fast and super easy to set up. The on screen instructions are sooo clear to follow. I couldn't imagine only having 3G these days, like when you are in an area that doesn't have 3G coverage, you can still use the Nook over Wi-fi.  This is truly one of the killer features of the Nook.  You can go into a B&N; store and Wi-fi to your hearts content, but then come home and do the same.  Hotels offering free Wi-fi are the Nooks biach.Memory ExpansionThe Nook has a Micro-SD card slot which accepts up to 16GB Micro-SD cards, this allows you to upgrade your memory indefinitely. Another advantage would be to organize your books. And books on the card are never going to get lost if your reader dies -- without having to re-download from the cloud.  Plus with the new B&N; desktop reader you can move your books from the Nook to a laptop/netbook on the fly, and what if the worst should happen and your eReader dies?  You still have those books on the card.AppearanceThis is a biggy for me as it is for most people... I don't tend to buy or use things that look ugly. That's why I've got an iPod instead of a Zune, why I've got a LCD TV instead of a CRT, and now why I've got a Nook instead of another reader. The appearance of this device can be described with one word, SEXY. It just looks good. Other readers currently available range from looking ""not too bad"" to looking downright ugly. This reader is the exception to that rule and employs a host of features to boot.Book formats and availabilityThis is probably the biggest of all the features, since we are talking about a book reader, the Nook boasts a whopping 1,000,000 books available for it, in readily readable format, from just two sources (B&N; and Google). The nearest competitor only offers 500,000 books in it's native format (Kindle). You can convert many books to a Kindle readable format, but it's a hassle and you have to use your computer to do that. Sort of defeats the purpose of the wireless if you have to constantly connect to the PC. And there are third party sources for books in Kindle format, probably websites you've never heard of, new sites pop up all the time since Kindle has a big install base, but the quality of books on those sites is in question compared to a reputable company like Google.eInk displayIt seems to be crisper than much of the competition out there. The ability to change the typeface and size of the fonts is wonderful. The nearest competitors screen almost seems fuzzy in comparison, which for me makes it harder to read. Page changes are fast on the Nook, while nothing can compare with the speed of changing a real books' page, it's fast enough for the average person. Speed readers may find themselves waiting for a few milliseconds though. The controls on the Nook are straightforward and intuitive.Replacable batteryThis is another biggy for most ebook people, with the Nook you can change the battery out should you A) want extended reading times without charge, or B) if the original battery dies for some reason.  Many of the other readers on the market do not allow this, which means they are bricked if the battery dies and will either have to be repaired or replaced.Battery lifeA lot has been said about the battery life of the Nook, and other eReaders.  All of the manufacturers of these devices overstate the real world battery life in real world useage situations.  I have a co-worker with one of the Amazon (Kindle Brand) eReaders and he has to charge every 3 - 4 days.  Nook lasts for me about 5 - 7 days, but it all depends on what features you use on either or any of the devices and how much you use them to determine actual, real world battery usage. Either way, all of these devices are easy to charge.  Just plug into a standard 110 - 120 outlet and PRESTO!  Or in the case of the Nook, you can also plug into your computer/laptop/netbook and VOILA!  You will be on go in no time flat.Ease of useThe Nook is easy to set up and use, The onscreen keyboard is more familiar and similar to modern devices than many of the competitors setups.SummaryThere are so many features of this device it's hard to capture them all in one review. All in all this is one great device, with it's iPod like look and feel, large number of built in features, and industry standard operating system, it's clearly the choice of discerning electronics customers.*******************************Update*******************************So, I had been told on these comments that the B&N; in store functionality was not ready to be used yet -- another lie dispelled today.  I stopped in at the B&N; in Hillsboro and it is in fact fully functional.  My Nook immediately recognized the B&N; network and connected without me even having to tell it to!  As it turns out there is exclusive content at each B&N; store, at this particular one there were multiple books that could be downloaded for FREE!!!  So, seeing one that piqued my interest I naturally downloaded it.  Wow, super fast and convenient, and FREE!,
","The experiences for people with product like this is all over the place because it will depend on the environment that one puts it in. This is an electrical product with capability to filter out electrical noises and power surge protect the equipments that connect to it. There is no magic here, pure sciences. It will do the most good in the worst electric environment like apartment or small home with few independent cicuits. If one have a microwave or vacuum cleaner running on the same circuit, it works great but it does not work as much mafic if there are no other power hungry appliances connect to the same circuit. Having said that, I would say that it is still a good investment for the thousands of dollars I put into the home theater system. The surge protection ability is better than anything less than $100 as it have protected my equipments from numerous thunderstorms and even a couple close lightning strikes over the years and it still works. It is also convenient to have the power outlets within the rack so one does not have all the wire running out of the back. I can honestly says that it probably  improves video quality some with clean AC power to the DVD player/receiver and the HD TV picture is cleaner and definitely less prone to power noises and voltage fluctuations. The audio quality coming out of my Yahama AV system if definitely better with less hisses and pops from the power noises and the power sub thumps nicely with no hums. The front panel also match the rest of the rack and the analog power meter is a nice touch. The LED could get a bit bright for home theater viewing but some electric tape will fix that or put it aside away from the TV screen. For a little over $120 including shipping, it is a bargain for me.,
","I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year.  I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it.  This is so even after I have purchased ""better lenses.""  I did take some test shots to post.  See the bougainvilla, cat, and ""Wild Thing"" test images above.  Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled ""bad lenses.""  In general, I have not found the  lens to be ""bad"" but instead to be a ""good lens when used appropriately.""  It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens.  But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:""It is a poor workman that blames his tools.""I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens.  I read this ""johnhopkins"" posting about this lens on the ""fredmiranda-com photo site."" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to ""fredmiranda-com.""  The poster ""johnhopkins"" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L.  He found that:""The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.""My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:""If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible."" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.,

99,"The Nook is the best e-reader yet. It replaces the keyboard on the Kindle with a color touch screen about the size of the iPhone display. This makes it easy to maneuver between  the store, your library, your current book, the daily (with messages, newsletters, and other free content), and settings. The LCD display changes from menu items to images of book covers to a keyboard as needed, and then turns off when reading.You can connect by both WiFI and free 3G to download a purchase in seconds, and connect with WiFi to get content and other offers when you walk into a B&N; store. I'm using the latest 1.1.1 SW release that fixes most of the issues noted in early reviews. Updates are done automatically over the air.The nook feels great in the hand with a slightly contoured back that adds a little thickness for the hand to grip. Controls are provided for equal usability by a left or right-hander person. The back is removable and replaceable with different colors. They are all rubber coated to make it less likely to drop. Unlike the Kindle the battery is replaceable and the memory is expandable. The e-ink display is the same type, but appears to be slightly crisper than the Kindle 2. The nook supports  EPUB (Non or Adobe DRM), PDB (Non DRM), PDF, Graphics: JPG, GIF, PNG, BMP, Audio: MP3, PDB. The online B&N; bookstore has about a million books compared to the Kindle store with half that, the major difference being the free public domain books provided by Google.Summary:While it costs the same as the Kindle, the nook is loaded with extra features: WiFi, color LCD, removable battery, expandable memory, more open book formats.  You can customize your nook with your own photos to create personal screen savers and lend between nook, iPhone, a PC and a Mac.,
","Had problems with these things from the start. The first one had a flaky display that flickered, the second one had a defective cradle that wouldn't charge. After much arguing with Handspring about how doing a hard reset of the unit would not fix a short in the cord on the cradle, I finally got all the parts and pieces working. By the way, Handspring technical support is probably the second worst I've ever encountered. Their toll-free line is just a recording telling you to call back on a non-toll-free line. That line is only available during business hours (California time), and wait times are regularaly 30-40 minutes. Finally, their support is pay-per-incident, an ugly trend in the industry these days.The unit worked pretty well for about six months. But then, I've found most Palm devices are created equal as far as that goes.  Display is crisp, colors are vivid, although if you're going to be using this outside, you'll probably want do get a model with a passive display rather than an active display like this one. It's almost impossible to see in sunlight.One thing I have noticed is that after six months, the unit doesn't hold it's charge quite as long. I've gone from three days between charges to just over 1 day. While this is supposed to be common with NiCad devices, the fact that you can't change the battery in this unit leads me to the conclusion that it's intended to be a rather expensive disposable device with about a 12-14 month lifespan. With the emergence of cell-phone PDA's and Internet PDA's, the unit will probably be obsolete before it's non-functional, but if you're planning to hold on to your PDA for a while, you'd best read carefully about replacement parts before making your decision.,
","Well, I read a lot of reviews of this lens, most of them negative so of course I was a little skeptical about buying this lens. I've been testing it out for a while and yeah I do admit the auto focus is kinda slow, but its alright since a lot of the time I manually focus it myself and since it isnt sticky i can do it fairly quickly and ive gotten a lot of sharp, clear pictures. Of course it can not compare to any of canon's L lenses but for the beginner or amateur photographer on a tight budget, or even a professional photographer that wants a decent backup lens, this one is great. It is fairly quiet which is a plus. A lot of people complain about it not having an ultra sonic motor or that its not good for action shots but those attributes are obvious before you even purchase the lens, those are the reasons why canon happened to make a version of this lens with the ultra sonic motor for faster auto focus. I use this lens on my Canon EOS rebel T1i and again it takes very sharp clear shots, and I have even done a few action shots with this because I always have my ISO speed on 3200 or 1600 so I can use faster shutter speeds, and when its extremely bright outside I set my shutter speed to 1/4000 (the fastest it can go) and if I need to I will lower the ISO speed or adjust my aperture. Now I do realize not everybody's SLR or DSLR can do the same settings I use and I know a lot of people prefer to not use such a high ISO so its really just personal preference. And a lot of complaints I have heard sound mostly like user error.,

100,"I had given my kids a Nook Color a couple years ago. Sold it last fall and got 1 girl a Kindle Fire 2nd gen, and the other a Lenovo A2107. The Lenovo was absolutely horrid so I wanted to replace it. This summer, when the Nook HD got Google Play, and the prices fell, I sold the Lenovo and got my daughter the Nook HD 16gb Snow. She absolutely loves it! I liked it so much, I got the Nook HD 8gb for myself. I like it much better than my Kindle Fire HD. The size is smaller, and thinner, and lighter, which are great things. And you can put whatever wallpaper you want on it, unlike the Fire HD.I sold the 2nd gen Kindle Fire and gave the other daughter the Fire HD, but she has since switched to a Nook also (HD+). So now I have the Fire HD and the Nook HD for myself. I like the Nook HD better for the reasons stated above. Size and weight are so much smaller on the Nook HD. The screen resolution is also better. There is nothing I don't like about the Nook HD. I did put a GreatShield Glare Screen protector on the Nooks, to reduce the shiny glare. We use them without cases, just sleeves. They are phenomenal tablets.If you or the person you are buying for loves to play games and will likely download hundreds of them, definitely get the 16gb Nook HD. You will want as much space for apps as you can afford, despite the SD card slot. Games have to be installed to internal memory, for the most part. The SD card slot comes in handy for books, movies, photos and music. I got the 8 gb Nook HD for myself, because I don't play games, the only apps I need are for reading, playing music, news, web, stuff like that. I put my files on the SD card and I am set!I don't plan to buy the new Fires when they come out.  They are far too limited, in my opinion. (So was the Nook, of course, until they added Google Play). I have ADW Launcher on all three of the Nooks, though my daughters tend to prefer the standard Nook launcher. What shows up on that home page can be customized to show only what you want it to show. There is also an ""app drawer"" icon that shows the most recently opened apps for easy launching. It really is a great design, and far superior to the tiresome carousel on the Kindle Fires.,
","I really wanted to wait before upgrading from Vdx, but since my Vdx was acting strangely and I wanted the VisorPhone, too,....I bit the bullet.I'm moderately satisfied, but unenthusiastic.PROS:  Bright screen, looks great indoors.  Nicer looking than VDX.CONS  Color quality is so-so.  Screen is barely readable outside or in any bright light. Huge problem.  I knew I would hate the lithium battery. I do.BUGS  --I did my first sync to my home computer to Lotus Organizer. Just as happened when I first bought a VDX, it asked me on installation if I wanted to keep my Lotus conduits. I said yes. It overwrote them all anyway, necessitating a reinstall of Easy Sync. Not such a big deal, but annoying.  --MORE dangerous: NONE of my Notepad entries sync'd and they were all wiped out. (Yes, I had them backed up. Wonder how many people won't?) Most of my calendar entries were wiped out, too. Not to mention a couple of hundred address book entries when my data was &quot;restored&quot; from backup folders.Yikes.MORE BUGS, but not nec Handspring's fault:  I love JOT, one of the most useful add-on programs. It does cause some conflicts with programs that required pen input to perform a function like BDICTY (translation) and AVANTGO (when using form submissions).With the upgrade to Visor PRISM though, the conflicts were more frequent. City Date/Time, Albums to Go, EyeModule and most anything that had graphical features caused fatal errors. I had to do two hard resets in the first 6 hours before I figured out that JOT was causing the problems. (And thank god for the backup modules....)CONCLUSION  On the whole, my biggest complaint is the  visibility of the screen outdoors. I think the cons outweigh the advantages here. I had to buy. If I didn't, I would note that is only a modest upgrade for a far higher price from VDX. I would have preferred to wait. If you can...see what's better next year! If you can't, it's a reasonably good product that is, however, overhyped.,
","I tried this lens out when looking for a low-cost telephoto lens for my Digital Rebel XT, side-by-side with the USM version, the IS version, and several L-series lenses in similar focal lengths (the latter being but a pipe dream and way out of my budget at the time).In short, if you want a lens with a long reach and have next to nothing to spend, this might be the lens for you.  I'd suggest spending the extra money on the USM version for the slightly-faster focusing--it's really just a pittance more, unlike the IS lens (although not appreciably sharper than this lens).Photos are remarkably soft, particularly toward the 300mm end.  If you want this lens for nature and sports photography, be prepared for a lot of work in Photoshop to get something sharp enough to use (and forget about professional-quality prints).The focus is very slow, and the lens itself rather slow throughout its range--and particularly at 300mm, where you're going to be locked into f5.6.  This means longer exposure times and/or requires better lighting, which limits its usefulness for capturing action at any distance.Personally, I'd save up a bit more or else rent a better lens if you immediately need something in this focal range.  However, if you're okay with the softness--perhaps you're only doing portraiture and want to put your camera halfway across the room?--and can deal with the other limitations, the lens is very affordable.,
